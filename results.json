The MCT detector arrays will be a high performance improvement to meet the detector needs for future NASA missions.  The MCT material for these detector arrays will be grown by molecular beam epitaxy on cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe or CZT) substrates to produce high quality semiconductor material with low defect densities. In this Phase I proposed effort EPIR, Inc. (EPIR) will fabricate a prototype focal plane array (FPA) where a 12 micron cutoff LWIR MCT detector array on a CZT substrate will be hybridized to a small format readout integrated circuit (ROIC) for capability demonstration purposes.  EPIR will deliver this prototype FPA to the government for further evaluation.  Should this effort progress to Phase II, then LWIR MCT detector arrays will be fabricated for hybridization to large format 1k x 1k ROICs for implementation into future planetary science space missions."}},

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California provided the data. The Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) is an airborne instrument for obtaining multi-angle imagery similar to that of the satellite-borne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument, which is designed to contribute to studies of the Earth's ecology and climate. AirMISR flies on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California built the instrument for NASA. Unlike the satellite-borne MISR instrument, which has nine cameras oriented at various angles, AirMISR uses a single camera in a pivoting gimbal mount. A data run by the ER-2 aircraft is divided into nine segments, each with the camera positioned to a MISR look angle. The gimbal rotates between successive segments, such that each segment acquires data over the same area on the ground as the previous segment. This process is repeated until all nine angles of the target area are collected. The swath width, which varies from 11 km in the nadir to 32 km at the most oblique angle, is governed by the camera's instantaneous field-of-view of 7 meters cross-track x 6 meters along-track in the nadir view and 21 meters x 55 meters at the most oblique angle. The along-track image length at each angle is dictated by the timing required to obtain overlap imagery at all angles, and varies from about 9 km in the nadir to 26 km at the most oblique angle. Thus, the nadir image dictates the area of overlap that is obtained from all nine angles. A complete flight run takes approximately 13 minutes. The 9 camera viewing angles are:0 degrees or nadir26.1 degrees, fore and aft45.6 degrees, fore and aft60.0 degrees, fore and aft70.5 degrees, fore and aft For each of the camera angles, images are obtained at 4 spectral bands. The spectral bands can be used to identify vegetation and aerosols, estimate surface reflectance and ocean color studies. The center wavelengths of the 4 spectral bands are:443 nanometers, blue555 nanometers, green670 nanometers, red865 nanometers, near-infrared Two types of AirMISR data products are available - the Level 1 Radiometric product (L1B1) and the Level 1 Georectified radiance product (L1B2)."}},

Three Spacecraft Fire Experiment (Saffire) flight units were developed and have flown on three sequential flights of Orbital ATK's Cygnus re-supply vehicle. Saffire-I was launched on OA-6 in March 2016, Saffire-II on OA-5 in October 2016, and Saffire-III on OA-7 in March 2017.\u00a0 The Saffire-I, II, and III experiments were all operated successfully in June 2016, November 2016, and June 2017, respectively. Three more Saffire experiments, Saffire-IV-VI, are now being developed to continue to investigate material flammability risks that will be faced by the crew on NASA's long duration exploration missions, especially at reduced pressure and higher oxygen concentrations. These experiments will also obtain data on large-scale spacecraft fire detection, monitoring, and post-fire cleanup\u00a0as well as obtain valuable data to allow spacecraft designers and engineers to predict the development of fire scenarios in exploration vehicles and habitats. The SFS Demo Project is managed by NASA John H. Glenn Research Center (GRC) who also developed the design and fabricated the hardware. Personnel from NASA Johnson Spaceflight Center and the NASA White Sands Test Facility were also instrumental in fabricating and testing the Saffire hardware. The NASA team is augmented by an international topical team assembled by the European Space Agency (ESA). Each member of this team brings expertise and funding from their respective space and research agencies for their activities. The experiment hardware for Saffire-I-VI is approximately 53 cm x 90 cm x 133 cm and consists of a flow duct, containing the sample material to be burned, fans, and flow straightener, and an avionics bay, containing the power management system, control computer, signal conditioning card, and cameras. Saffire-I and III had a single large sample (0.4 m x 0.9 m) made of a composite fabric (75% cotton/25% fiberglass by mass) that has been studied in previous low-gravity experiments although using much smaller samples. This sample burned completely during the tests and yielded information about the fate (flame size and spread rate) of a large-scale fire in low-gravity. Saffire-II had nine samples (5-cm wide x 30-cm long) of various materials that were selected to investigate the low-gravity Maximum Oxygen Concentration (MOC) flammability limits in long-term low gravity. These samples emulate the configuration used in NASA-STD-6001 Test 1, the flammability test conducted in normal gravity to determine if a flame will spread upward over the sample or if it will self-extinguish. A material that self-extinguishes is considered as being safe for use in spacecraft from the standpoint of flammability. To conduct the Saffire experiments, the Saffire hardware is loaded in the Cygnus Pressurized Cargo Module by Orbital ATK and launched from the Wallops Flight Facility. Once at the International Space Station, Saffire\u00a0remains unpowered on Cygnus while supplies for the ISS are off-loaded by the crew. Once supplies are off-loaded and replaced with trash, Cygnus departs. When the vehicle reaches a safe distance from the ISS,\u00a0Saffire will be powered on by a team of Orbital ATK and Saffire engineers working from Orbital ATK's Dulles Control Center in Dulles, VA. After conducting system checks, Cygnus will be put into free drift and the experiment initiated. Saffire-I, II, and III ran autonomously for about 2-1/2 hours. With the expanded objectives of Saffire-IV-VI, the experiment will require about 8 hours to be completed. When the experiment is complete, Cygnus continues to orbit the earth while the data is downlinked to various ground stations.

The IRAD investigation will mature a sensitive, wide-field instrument design optimized to produce new and unique observations of transient astrophysical events (supernova shock breakout, gamma-ray bursts, tidal disruption events, and variable stars and quasars). With this design concept in hand, the CUTIE CubeSat mission will be ready to begin development should it be approved for funding. Our primary objective is the design of a science instrument \u2013 in this case, a wide field-of-view ultraviolet camera \u2013 with the largest possible aperture for a CubeSat payload. We intend to incorporate new techniques such as 3D printing of lightweight structures, combined with commercial CCDs and Goddard\u2019s unique expertise in the development of high performance compact science instruments in the ultraviolet.CUTIE\u2019s science case is based on several transient phenomena that are best, and in some cases only, observable in the ultraviolet from space. One such example is the early shock breakout from supernovae. This signal, coming in the UV when radiation from the expanding shockwave first escapes from the stellar envelope, directly encodes the radius of the progenitor star \u2013 information that is lost at later times and at longer wavelengths. \u00a0 \u00a0CUTIE should find one such supernova every day during operation.This innovative transient monitoring strategy relies on a very wide field of view with high efficiency ultraviolet optics. The \u00e9tendue of this CubeSat instrument is 30 times greater than that of GALEX, the last UV Explorer mission, yet can be done with a small, low-cost design. This permits roughly 10% of the sky to be patrolled repeatedly for time-variable sources at high sensitivity. The novelty of such capability with such modest project scope will make for a compelling CubeSat proposal.We intend to mature the science payload through four parallel paths, all equally important. One thrust will be to produce a capable optical design, crucial to being able to realize the science promise of the mission. A second will be to develop a telescope structure suitable for a CubeSat in a lightweight format. The third consists of the design of a low-power, low-noise CCD controller to provide high sensitivity imaging. The fourth task is to develop a detailed science simulation framework that can be used to predict the performance of CUTIE for all its science cases as a function of the instrument design and operational plan.The CUTIE concept is for a 6U payload, which can accommodate a telescope of roughly 9cm diameter. With baffling, it will consume around 2U, while the CCD chip and readout electronics will fit in the 1U behind the optics. An additional 3U for the spacecraft components, particularly for power and attitude determination/control, are fully used. All the spacecraft components and the 6U structure are commercially available, CubeSat-specific designs. A mechanical prototype of such a structure with a representative telescope has been produced by the company ISIS (figure at above right). It features a skeletonized structure with multiple mounting points, space for standard CubeSat electronics, and full bay space for larger systems such as an attitude determination/control system.These four design elements enabled the CUTIE CubeSat mission concept to be proposed in March 2015 to ROSES/APRA, for a single flight design and build (total cost a few $M). In the future,\u00a0multiple copies of CUTIE can be funded as an Explorer Mission of Opportunity, with the swarm of CubeSats enabling improved sky coverage, sensitivity, and/or cadence of the time-domain monitoring of transient sources."}},

In addition, combing the low-cost laser-based demodulation technique and an acousto-ultrasonic method we will demonstrate the polymer gratings' capability to monitor ultrasonic stress waves indicating the presence and severity of damages in a metal structure, when the structure is probed by an ultrasonic wave generation actuator device."}},

The human hand demands a complex range of motions, a close fit, an ease of movement, and a lack of bulk that is at odds with the engineering and durability requirements of an inflated safety garment.  While precision motions of the fingers are relatively well met by NASA's current I.L.C./Phase VI gloves, the torque required for more gross power grips such as translating along bars or grasping tools is significant.  This torque comes not from the individual fingers or phalange-phalange joints, but at the joint between the fingers and the palm, or the metacarpal-phalangeal joint.\n    In addition, this motion is difficult to precisely measure.  The human hand is capable of omni-directional multifaceted movements that are challenging to mimic robotically.  In addition, the presence of a human wearer makes the measurement impossible to repeat accurately, but it is required to adequately reproduce the movements of the glove.\n    FFD in collaboration with The Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly) propose to develop a glove pattering specific to the bending of the metacarpal-phalangeal joint, and a robotic instrument suitable to measure this torque.  This will lead to even more functional glove pressure garments, and to a more refined way of measuring them."}},

The frequency difference of the two optical wavelengths can be tuned by changing the phase matching condition of either one of the sub-OPOs.

Resupply of water is prohibitively costly for such extended missions.  Water reclamation processes typically recover 90-95% of the water present in wastewater formed by combining urine, hygiene water, and humidity condensate with the remaining concentrated in brine.  This concentrated brine contains a significant amount of water, potentially a very valuable resource.  The proposed prototype development will recover virtually all of the remaining water using an ultrasonic brine dewatering system (UBDS).  In the UBDS process, extremely small nebulized droplets of the brine are created ultrasonically at the brine-air interface.  Small droplets enable quicker drying due to their high relative surface area. This is particularly important when drying brines that contain thermally labile materials, which require relatively low temperature drying.  The UBDS prototype has no nozzles to become plugged, requires little power, is simple and small, requires minimal astronaut attention and is compatible with continuous, closed cycle operation that can be made gravity independent.

At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with a hybrid wick, which has a sintered evaporator wick, and a conventional grooved adiabatic and condenser wick.  These hybrid wicks can operate at higher heat fluxes, allowing the use of higher power laser diodes.  They also allow the use of Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) in Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, which must operate at tilts up to 45\u00b0.  Conventional aluminum/ammonia heat pipes can only operate with a 0.1 inch tilt, so they are unsuitable.  Loop Heat Pipes can also operate with tilting, but they are two orders of magnitude more expensive.  A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick."}},

This project is concerned with the development of small-size, and low power wideband phased arrays (with digital beam forming) for satellites and multi-mission deep space exploration. For the first time, the proposed simple/low-cost phased array will enable on-demand sensing at multiple bands, coupled with adjustable high resolution imaging across various bands. Central to the proposed small wideband array is its unprecedented 20:1 bandwidth. This proposal will build upon this game-changing technology to develop (a) feed networks of equal bandwidth to the phased array, operating at millimeter wavelengths and sub-terahertz frequencies, and (b) low cost beam former technology utilizing on-site encoding to separate signals prior to digitization. This novel on-site coding will allow for a single analog to digital (ADC) or digital to analog converter (DAC) to serve as many as 64 antenna array elements.

They are structurally similar to Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) and share extraordinary mechanical properties, but differ in chemical, optical, and electrical properties. Hybrid nanotubes constructed of B, C, and N elements are expected to form a new class of NTs with tunable properties between those of CNTs and BNNTs with increased applications.BNNTs are produced by a new, high temperature pressurized vapor/condensation (PVC) technique without catalysts, using only boron and nitrogen as reactants. BNNTs are electrical insulators with a reported bandgap of about 6.0eV regardless of the chirality. This project adapts the PVC synthesis method to generate and investigate nanotubes consisting of boron, carbon and nitrogen with a controlled composition ratio. It is envisioned that BxCyNz nanotubes with the same excellent properties will be produced (radiation resistance and high aspect ratio, crystallinity and service temperature) but with different electronic and optical properties as a function of B, C, and N composition. With the incorporation of carbon, a tailored bandgap is possible from insulating/semiconducting (6.0eV) to metallic (0eV). Systematic modifications to the current apparatus will be applied to introduce carbon into the reaction zone where B and N precursors combine. In the new method, carbon can be added to the boron vapor through a number of methods. Various density ratios can be achieved with various buffer gases and the presence of oxygen may be useful in scavenging byproducts of the synthesis process. Carbon can be added to the boron vapor plume by modifying the target. Modeling will be used to modify the reaction chamber and parameters to produce optimized BCN nanotubes. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) can provide morphology assessment and the composition analysis by using electron diffraction, X-ray mapping, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and energy filtered TEM (EFTEM).

The performance of these applications would benefit significantly from materials designed for high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions. NASA's Venus mission has some of the most stringent requirements with an operating temperature of 486C. Power systems must operate efficiently at these temperatures to eliminate the need for onboard cooling systems. The removal of these cooling systems will save space, reduce weight, and improve reliability. Currently, BaTiO3-based X7R capacitors are re-rated for use above 125C, and are rendered inoperable at temperatures approaching 300C. NPO-type dielectrics tend to operate at somewhat higher temperatures, but have low dielectric constants and become unreliable above 400C. TRS Technologies is pleased to respond to NASA's need for high temperature capacitors with this Phase I SBIR proposal. In this SBIR program, TRS Technologies and its subsidiary, Centre Capacitor, will develop a new family of high temperature capacitors based on high Curie temperature ferroelectrics that operate at temperatures far beyond conventional dielectric formulations. These new higher temperature (~490C) materials will be suited for the advanced power electronics required for Venus exploration."}},

Each XRS observation results in four X-ray spectra. When an X-ray interacts with one of the four detectors, a charge or voltage pulse is generated. This signal is converted into one of 2^8 (256) channels, which are correlated to energy. Over a commanded integration time period a histogram of counts as a function of energy (channel number) is recorded. The EDRs are the number of events in each channel of the four detectors accumulated over the integration period. Channels above or below the useful energy range of the detectors are not transmitted. The result is three 244-channel GPC histograms and one 231-channel solar monitor histogram, each of which is designated as a single X-ray spectrum.

Its importance will continue as traffic volumes grow and new vehicle classes are introduced. In particular, as new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations become more prevalent, methodologies to quantify performance of both human-centered and autonomous operations will be required. The objective of this work is to discover opportunities for improvement in operations of the National Airspace System (NAS), using methods that advance the state of the art and that can be applied to both current and future operations. To that end, Mosaic ATM proposes to develop a tool that will characterize and classify the efficiency of airspace operations, with a focus on airport metroplex operations.

These figure errors, which occur at spatial frequencies outside the DM control band, are the most significant technological development hurdle preventing the use of MEMS DMs in proximity glare suppression for astronomical coronagraphy. Such wavefront control devices fill a critical technology gap in NASA's vision for high-contrast, high-resolution space based imaging and spectroscopy instruments. Space-based telescopes have become indispensible in advancing the frontiers of astrophysics. Over the past decade NASA has pioneered coronagraphic instrument concepts and test beds to provide a foundation for exploring feasibility of new approaches to high-contrast imaging. From this work, NASA has identified a current technology need for compact, ultra-precise, multi-thousand actuator DM devices. Boston Micromachines Corporation has developed MEMS DMs that represents the state-of-the-art for scalable, small-stroke high-precision wavefront control. The emerging class of high-resolution DMs pioneered by the project team has already been shown to be compact, low-power, precise, and repeatable. These DMs can be currently produced with uncorrectable shape errors as small as 10nm root mean square (rms). The residual shape errors on the DM are mostly periodic and act essentially as a grating, producing diffraction spikes in the image plane. In the Phase I effort, DM fabrication process modifications were developed which will enable the manufacture of these enabling components with an unprecedented surface figure of less than 2nm rms by eliminating surface features resulting from print-through , etch access holes, and mirror attachment posts, and compensating for residual stress induced scalloping."}},

This particular flight took place on August 24, 2003. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California provided the data. There were a total of two runs during this flight. A run comprises data collected from nine view angles acquired on a fixed flight azimuth angle. Each data file from one run contains either: a) Level 1B1 Radiometric product from one of the 9 camera angles or b) Level 1B2 Georectified radiance product from one of the 9 camera angles. Browse images in PNG format are available for the Level 1B1 product and browse images in JPEG format are available for the Level 1B2 product. The Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) is an airborne instrument for obtaining multi-angle imagery similar to that of the satellite-borne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument, which is designed to contribute to studies of the Earth's ecology and climate. AirMISR flies on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California built the instrument for NASA. Unlike the satellite-borne MISR instrument, which has nine cameras oriented at various angles, AirMISR uses a single camera in a pivoting gimbal mount. A data run by the ER-2 aircraft is divided into nine segments, each with the camera positioned to a MISR look angle. The gimbal rotates between successive segments, such that each segment acquires data over the same area on the ground as the previous segment. This process is repeated until all nine angles of the target area are collected. The swath width, which varies from 11 km in the nadir to 32 km at the most oblique angle, is governed by the camera's instantaneous field-of-view of 7 meters cross-track x 6 meters along-track in the nadir view and 21 meters x 55 meters at the most oblique angle. The along-track image length at each angle is dictated by the timing required to obtain overlap imagery at all angles, and varies from about 9 km in the nadir to 26 km at the most oblique angle. Thus, the nadir image dictates the area of overlap that is obtained from all nine angles. A complete flight run takes approximately 13 minutes. The 9 camera viewing angles are:0 degrees or nadir26.1 degrees, fore and aft45.6 degrees, fore and aft60.0 degrees, fore and aft70.5 degrees, fore and aft For each of the camera angles, images are obtained at 4 spectral bands. The spectral bands can be used to identify vegetation and aerosols, estimate surface reflectance and ocean color studies. The center wavelengths of the 4 spectral bands are:443 nanometers, blue555 nanometers, green670 nanometers, red865 nanometers, near-infrared Two types of AirMISR data products are available - the Level 1 Radiometric product (L1B1) and the Level 1 Georectified radiance product (L1B2). The Level 1 Radiometric product contains data that are scaled to convert the digital output of the cameras to radiances and are conditioned to remove instrument-dependent effects. Additionally, all radiances are adjusted to remove slight spectral sensitivity differences among the detector elements of each spectral band. These data have a 7-meter spatial resolution at nadir and around 30-meter at the most oblique 70.5 degree angles. The Level 1 Georectified radiance product contains the Level 1 radiometric product resampled to a 27.5 meter spatial resolution and mapped into a standard Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection. Initially the data are registered to each camera angle and to the ground. This processing is necessary because the nine views of each point on the ground are not acquired simultaneously. Once the map grid center points are located in the AirMISR imagery through the process of georectification, a radiance value obtained from the surrounding AirMISR pixels is assigned to that ma"}},

BCI's novel approach incorporates the innovations of the highly successful multiple-antenna detection technique and the optimized fast quad diversity combiner technique, enabling BCI to meet NASA's requirements for reliability, safety, and high accuracy by effectively nullifying the interference noise from GPS receiver data and eliminating errors and ambiguities in observables. The NRAI system offers a 4-6 dB SNR improvement factor over current techniques and increases the accuracy of L1 C/A navigation to less than 1 m and 1 cm/s, which directly fulfills NASA's requirement of anti-spoofing ability and high accuracy. In Phase I BCI will demonstrate the feasibility of the NRAI system by building and testing a preliminary prototype, which will demonstrate TRL-level 3-4 by the end of Phase I. In Phase II, BCI plans to develop a fully functional prototype and demonstrate the anti-spoofing and high-accuracy navigation performance of NRAI.

The PS2-thioaptamers are binding agents with functionality comparable to antibodies but with very long shelf-life under ambient environment storage.

In fact, solid state lighting, high-temperature and high-power electronics, microelectronic and mechanical sensors, and high-efficiency solar cells are all poised at a new level of development. This enormous market is waiting for low-cost, high quality substrates to achieve performance and fabrication economies of scale. After achieving dislocation densities below 1E7 cm-2 in the phase I work, this NASA SBIR phase II project addresses the development of a dislocation filter that can routinely prepare low-stress GaN thin films with threading dislocation densities below 1E6 cm-2. The method relies on using a low-angle ion beam to induce both nanofilter for defect reductions and to inhibit droplet formation at low growth temperatures. Dislocation densities have so far been determined by standard etch pit densities method. The goal the project to optimize the multiple defect nanofilter with smoothening by transition layers in between filters to reduce the TD to less than 1E6 cm-2 and process, fabricate high performance HEMT for solid state high power amplifier (SSPA) applications. To obtain a more practical evaluation of the effectiveness and commercial viability of the method, heterojunction field effect transistors with high electron mobility will be fabricated in these ultra-low defect density films. These high-quality material based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) will enable high linearity power amplifiers with excellent thermal stability and frequency response.

These demanding requirements have asked a material scientist to seek for a new type of actuator materials. Recently, we discovered a bulk-scale novel intermetallic compound CaFe2As2 that can exhibit superelastic deformation and ultra-high strength, which leads to unusually high actuation power per volume, 10~1000 times larger than most actuator materials, as well as cryogenic linear shape memory effects even near 0 K. The cryogenic linear actuation of this crystal is exceptionally repeatable, precise, and reliable with almost no fatigue damage, which would guarantee the long lifetime and high accuracy in actuation motion. Therefore, the research objective of this proposal is to develop a small-volume, high-precision and mechanically-robust cryogenic linear actuator by performing the combined set of works that include (1) large single crystal growth of novel intermetallic compound CaFe2As2 and related structures, (2) evaluation of their cryogenic linear actuation performance, (3) understanding of fundamental physics behind cryogenic actuation properties, and (4) development of proto-type linear actuators that operates at a temperature between 4 and 150 K."}},

Sometimes these instruments are built in a phased approach, with additional measurement capabilities added in later phases. In other cases, technology may mature to the point that the instrument offers new measurement capabilities that were not planned in the original design of the instrument. In still other cases, high resolution spectral measurements may be too costly to perform on a large sample and therefore lower resolution spectral instruments are used to take the majority of measurements. Many applied science questions that are relevant to the earth science remote sensing community require analysis of enormous amounts of data that were generated by instruments with disparate measurement capabilities. This paper addresses this problem using Virtual Sensors: a method that uses modelstrained on spectrally rich (high spectral resolution) data to \"fill in\" unmeasured spectral channels in spectrally poor (low spectral resolution) data. The models we use in this paper are Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels and SVMs with Mixture Density Mercer Kernels (MDMK). We demonstrate this method by using models trained on the high spectral resolution Terra MODIS instrument to estimate what the equivalent of the MODIS 1.6 micron channel would be for the NOAA AVHRR/2 instrument. The scientific motivation for the simulation of the 1.6 micron channel is to improve the ability of the AVHRR/2 sensor to detect clouds over snow and ice."}},

An Omnimagnet is a cube with no moving parts, capable of real-time control of the magnitude and orientation of its magnetic field. If a magnetic tool is introduced in an Omnimagnet\u2019s magnetic field, the Omnimagnet can dexterously manipulate the tool\u2019s position and orientation. This method of manipulation is unlike any other telerobotic manipulation technique. In space, Omnimagnets will be able to manipulate each other and their separate magnetic tools, utilizing magnetic forces and torques that go beyond simple attraction and repulsion. By fixing to various spacecraft or satellite surfaces, Omnimagnets can walk across surfaces and magnetically carry tools large distances, using inchworm inspired approaches. Thus, Omnimagnets can deliver tools to the worksite and then manipulate those tools, potentially enabling safer and more cost-effective procedures. Satellite repair, debris removal from convoluted hard-to-reach structures, and assembly of structures in microgravity are some of the challenges that Omnimagnets and their tools will tackle in space. Like other manipulation systems operating in space (e.g., Robonaut 2, SmartSPHERES), Omnimagnets will be able to relieve astronauts of both tedious routine maintenance tasks and highly dangerous extra-vehicular activity. Magnetic manipulation and inchworm locomotion in microgravity is a unique approach to coordinated motion that may contribute to other mobile manipulation projects. The design is also modular, allowing for Omnimagnets of various sizes and attachment mechanisms to work together to manipulate a diverse set of tools in a variety of environments. Furthermore, Omnimagnet manipulation will be safe for operation with and around humans, with no internally moving parts, low forces, and slow manipulation speeds. This project will involve: (1) the development of models and simulations of multiple Omnimagnets in a variety of manipulation scenarios; (2) the design and construction of a set of Omnimagnets, as well as a tool for the Omnimagnets to manipulate; (3) the development of a localization method for the Omnimagnets and their tools based on magnetic and range-finding techniques; (4) the construction of an aquarium to simulate microgravity, and attached air-filled containers to make the Omnimagnets and tool neutrally buoyant; (5) the experimental demonstration of manipulation techniques with the set of Omnimagnets and the tool using direct telemanipulation; and (6) the algorithm development and experimental demonstration of supervised autonomous control, in which the low-level Omnimagnet control is handled in software to achieve the human user\u2019s desired high-level commands."}},

This is invaluable for providing maximum functionality in a limited footprint. Current broadly tunable mid-infrared laser systems utilize one or more laser gain chips and mechanical external cavity tuning in order to span a wide spectral range. This technique is sensitive to mechanical shock and has a limited tuning speed. Our goal is to replace these systems with a compact source that is electrically tunable and mechanically robust. This is a potentially transformative technology that will dramatically improve both SWaP and reliability for future NASA missions. The main goal will be accomplished via three main research tracks: 1) Engineering a broadband gain medium based on quantum cascade laser technology; 2) Development of a multi-section, electrically tunable laser design for the mid-infrared; 3) On-chip beam combining and amplification for high power and excellent beam quality."}},

However, they have proven to be extremely difficult and costly to fabricate and are not presently available over a large part of the terahertz frequency band (100 GHz through 10 THz). Also, the terahertz filters that are available from commercial suppliers tend to have unacceptable loss in the pass-band (20% or more) and often cost over one thousand dollars per filter. Through this program VDI is developing new fabrication processes and mesh designs that will improve performance and greatly reduce costs.

Epidemiological data show that from adolescence through middle age cancer incidence increases with age. This effect is commonly attributed to a lifetime accumulation of cellular particularly DNA damage. However during middle-age the incidence begins to decelerate and for many tumor sites it actually decreases at sufficiently advanced ages. We investigated if the observed deceleration and potential decrease in incidence could be attributed to a decreased capacity of older hosts to support tumor progression and whether HZE (high atomic number (Z) high energy (E)) radiation differentially modulates tumor progression in young versus middle-age hosts issues relevant to estimating carcinogenesis risk for astronauts. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into syngeneic mice (143 and 551 days old) which were then subject to whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu). Three findings emerged: 1) among unirradiated animals substantial inhibition of tumor progression and significantly decreased tumor growth rates were seen for middle-aged mice compared to young mice; 2) whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) inhibited tumor progression in both young and in middle-aged mice (with greater suppression seen in case of young animals) with little effect on tumor growth rates; and 3) 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) suppressed tumor progression in young mice to a degree not significantly different than transiting from young to middle-aged. Thus 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) acted similar to aging with respect to tumor progression. We further investigated the molecular underpinnings driving the radiation modulation of tumor dynamics in young and middle-aged mice. Through global gene expression analysis the key players FASN AKT1 and the CXCL12/CXCR4 complex were determined to be contributory. In sum these findings demonstrate a reduced capacity of middle-aged hosts to support the progression phase of carcinogenesis and identify molecular factors contributory to HZE radiation modulation of tumor progression as a function of age. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina San Diego CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion Austin TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. The number of tumor sample replicates used from each condition is as follows: 10 samples from young unirradiated mice 8 samples from young irradiated mice 7 samples from middle-aged unirradiated mice 5 samples from middle-aged irradiated mice. Total RNA was isolated and purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) or RNeasy (Qiagen) quantified and qualified using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had O.D. 260/280 = 1.7 - 2.1 28s/18s = 2:1 RIN (RNA integrity number) >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using Ambion TotalPrep (Ambion) and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan (Illumina) and the data were analyzed using GenomeStudio (Illumina). Data were first analyzed for gene expression and then culled for present genes (genes that meet the criteria of detection p-value < 0.05). Expression above background was included in an expressed genes working data set for further analyses. Rank variant normalization was applied to the data before extensive analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was used to compare to the reference group young unirradiated mice and genes were then evaluated and validated."}},

The fourth file contains climate data recorded at a weather station located in the study area for the length of the study.The Tumugi study sites consist of three different natural steppes dominated by Filifolium sibiricum, Stipa baicalensis, and Leymus chinense, respectively. Measurements of above- and below-ground live biomass were made monthly throughout the growing season (March to November) by clipping 1.0 m2 quadrats and sampling 1.0 m2 soil pits to a depth of 1.0 m, respectively. The study areas had been protected from grazing since 1976.Above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) was estimated at 155 g/m2/year (average for the three steppes, based on peak above-ground living biomass). Peak live below-ground biomass was used to estimate below-ground net primary productivity (BNPP): 968 g/m2/year for the F. sibiricum steppe; 983 g/m2/year the Stipa baicalensis steppe; and 1,022 g/m2/year for the L. chinense steppe. Above- and below-ground biomass data were compared with simulation results from the CENTURY model. Simulated data agreed reasonably well with the observed data (within +25%)."}},

With the advent of icephobic nanocoatings, there have been attempts to develop a durable passive anti-ice coating. However, success to date has been limited. The state of the art can be advanced if anti-ice coatings can be made more durable, and are made to function synergistically with active de-icing techniques.

In Phase I, we will develop and analytically characterize humidity-sensitive materials, and prepare flexible sensor patches. In Phase II, we will manufacture prototypes for aeronautic qualification and conduct extensive testing under simulated environmental conditions. Sensitive patches to O2 and CO2 interrogated by the same electronic unit could be incorporated."}},

In recent years, the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) safety offices have been researching ways to utilize the many safety databases maintained by the FAA, such as those involving flight recorders, radar tracks, weather, and many other high-volume sensors, in order to monitor this unique and complex system. Although a number of current technologies do monitor the frequency of known safety risks in the NAS, very few methods currently exist that are capable of analyzing large data repositories with the purpose of discovering new and previously unmonitored safety risks. While monitoring the frequency of known events in the NAS enables mitigation of already identified problems, a more proactive approach of finding unidentified issues still needs to be addressed. This is especially important in the proactive identification of new, emergent safety issues that may result from the planned introduction of advanced NextGen air traffic management technologies and procedures. Development of an automated tool that continuously evaluates the NAS to discover both events exhibiting flight characteristics indicative of safety-related concerns as well as operational anomalies will heighten the awareness of such situations in the aviation community and serve to increase the overall safety of the NAS. This paper discusses the extension of previous anomaly detection work to identify operationally significant flights within the highly complex airspace encompassing the New York area of operations, focusing on the major airports of Newark International (EWR), LaGuardia International (LGA), and John F. Kennedy International (JFK). In addition, flight traffic in the vicinity of Denver International (DEN) airport/airspace is also investigated to evaluate the impact on operations due to variances in seasonal weather and airport elevation. From our previous research, subject matter experts determined that some of the identified anomalies were significant, but could not reach conclusive findings without additional supportive data. To advance this research further, causal examination using domain experts is continued along with the integration of air traffic control (ATC) voice data to shed much needed insight into resolving which flight characteristic(s) may be impacting an aircraft's unusual profile. Once a flight characteristic is identified, it could be included in a list of potential safety precursors. This paper also describes a process that has been developed and implemented to automatically identify and produce daily reports on flights of interest from the previous day."}},

Consequently, monitoring plug loads will be critical to achieve energy efficient operations. In this paper we describe the development of a knowledge-based system to analyze data collected from a plug load management system that allows for metering and control of individual loads. Since Sustainability Base was not yet occupied at the time of this investigation, the study was conducted in another building on the Ames campus to prototype the system. The paper focuses on the knowledge engineering and verification of a modular software system that promotes efficient use of office building plug loads. The knowledge-based system generates summary usage reports and alerts building personnel of malfunctioning equipment and unexpected plug load consumption. The system is planned to be applied to Sustainability Base and is expected to identify malfunctioning loads and reduce building energy consumption."}},

However, as the strategic need to optimize the interoperability, interdependencies, and interrelationship of missions increases, the benefits of enterprise solutions and expanded information accessibility become more apparent. This proposal addresses that need by seeking to create the capacity for ground-based support for very high data rates and extremely large mission data volumes in a secure enterprise environment to allow mission data exchange and aggregation.The objective of this project is to take information from multiple operational environments and securely deliver it in a graphically useful manner to the end user. This flow of information must be tightly controlled and protected to prevent unintentional leaks of sensitive data prior to receipt by the user. Once the data reaches the user, it must be presented in a useful manner. A simple example of this sort of information would be log messages. A user cannot simply be sent all log messages; the originating system must have the ability to configure which messages will be made available and the end user must be able to filter critical alarm alert messages from mundane logs. The unique challenge of this project is not only its technical feasibility, but also the need to meet GSFC's network security requirements. The capability to move small amounts of data for a single mission with limited security has been demonstrated; however the problem of moving larger amounts of data quickly while keeping the process compliant with GSFC network security practices has not been solved. Work on this IRAD will be performed in collaboration with Goddard Communications and Security Services Division to ensure that all software is in compliance with these GSFC network security requirements. Once the data arrives at its destination it must be strategically presented to maximize its usefulness. There are, of course, many possible applications that can be conceived to meet mission operations needs, such as health and status displays of operational components. The scope of this work will include selecting and implementing a presentation of the data that will be of most benefit to end-users. Based on current knowledge of mission needs, this application will focus on presenting the status of mission operations hardware and software for one or multiple missions. This will allow both the monitoring of single missions and the consolidate aggregation of status information for the monitoring of large portions of the GSFC Satellite Fleet. The key deliverables for the first phase of this proposal are the software transport framework to move data from the operations center to the user, \u00a0the corresponding web-based application to display the targeted data, and instructions on how to enable and configure the integrated application to ensure compliance with GSFC network security requirements. The compliant framework and web application will be shown in a self-contained demonstration that illustrates the complete and secure flow of information. The resultant software application will also be compliant with the Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) architecture.\u00a0 GMSEC is a software-based architecture built on a publish/subscribe messaging framework, which addresses many long-standing issues associated with point-solution implementations of mission control center systems."}},

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates.

The cost of a missed capture or improper arm/vehicle contact is likely to be very high. Since these operations may be performed up to six months after the most recent ground-based training, crews aboard the ISS prepare for such manual robotic tasks with the Robotics On-Board Trainer, a laptop-based graphical/dynamic simulator using NASA Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphic (DOUG) software from Johnson Space Center's Virtual Reality Laboratory. This system, however, does not utilize any real-world, 3-D, out-the-window views. Building upon recent advances in head-mounted augmented reality systems, the team of Systems Technology, Inc. and Dr. Stephen Robinson of UC Davis propose the Station Manipulator Arm Augmented Reality Trainer (SMAART) that will offer ISS crews significantly more realistic on-board refresher training for vehicle capture by manipulating the actual SSRMS with real out-the-Cupola-window views, but with a graphically-simulated vehicle overlaid on the astronaut's non-simulated view via a head-mounted display.

Existing simulation tools used in performing observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) assume a fixed set of sensor parameters in terms of observation geometry, frequencies used, resolution, or observation time, which allows simplifications to be made in the simulation process and allows sensor observation errors to be characterized a-priori. Adaptive sensors may vary all of these parameters depending on the scene observed, so that sensor performance is not simple to model without conducting OSSE simulations including sensor adaptation in response to stochastic variations in the scenes observed. The management of power and data volume resources on small satellite platforms as well as methods to allow collaborative sensing among sensors on multiple platforms are also high current needs for inclusion in mission simulation tools.\nThe library will be developed based on the past experience of the project team with the development of OSSE and mission planning tools for multiple projects.

A hybrid LES/RANS computational framework is proposed for prediction of noise from the engine and airframe, and interactions between airframe and propulsion systems. \nThe basis of LES (large eddy simulation) is that the energy-bearing turbulent eddies in the dominant noise-generating region are directly captured in the simulation. Since LES must resolve the turbulent eddies it requires a grid which captures these motions; the number of grid points needed for LES is much larger than those for RANS and thus a brute-force LES of the entire noise producing region in a propulsion-airframe interaction problem is not feasible. However, the noise generation physics of these flows allows a logical assembly of a hybrid simulation tool where low-fidelity models (RANS) in one region of the flow are combined with turbulence-resolving models (LES) in other regions of the flow. Acoustic effects are another segment of propulsion-airframe interaction problem. Sound generated by various components of engine is altered by the presence of wing, fuselage, deployed flap etc. In the present proposal, alteration of sound due to the presence of airframe is added through application of Boundary Element Method (BEM) and an acoustic projection technique (FW-H surface method). \nTo demonstrate the feasibility of using this framework, we focus on simulating flow configuration corresponding to a separate-flow nozzle of by pass ratio  5 with round fan and nozzle operating at the takeoff cycle point of with freestream Mach number of 0.28. Simulation results will be validated against experiments carried out in the Low Speed Aeroacoustics Wind Tunnel (LSAWT) at NASA Langley's Jet Noise Laboratory (JNL). The high-fidelity model developed and validated in Phase I will be extended to explore more complex engine/airframe configurations in Phase II."}},

Each of the 384 receivers amplifies RF signals, and down-converts them to an intermediate frequency (IF). As a result, 768 in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals are produced with a frequency of 10 to 500MHz. The IF signals have to be normalized and digitized with 1Gs/s sampling rate for further cross-correlation. Each signal from one arm of the receiver must be cross-correlated with all signals from the other two arms, therefore a system containing 196,000 parallel cross-correlation blocks is needed. Since the GeoSTAR is a space born instrument, low power dissipation and ensuring system reliability, through processing redundancy, are one of the most important requirements. A system assembled by using off-the-shelf components would be extremely power inefficient, bulky, and unreliable. Therefore, a system that is based on application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) is required. While working on the NASA's SBIR Phase II project \"Low Power Cross-Correlator ASIC\" (NNX13CP01C), Pacific Microchip Corp. has developed and fabricated  an ASIC that includes 128-element array of 2-bit 1GS/s ADCs, and 4096 parallel cross-correlation cells.

The isotopes 2H and 3He in the cosmic radiation are mainly secondary products from the p-p and p-4He interactions of primary cosmic rays in the interstellar medium. Other reactions such as 4He - 4He and p-(Z > 3) contribute to a lesser extent to the production of 2H and 3He, as well as antiprotons. In the past most isotope measurements have been limited by statistics and mass resolution. BESS-Polar II flew for 24.5 days over Antarctica in 2007-2008. It recorded 4.7 billion events, about 5 times events collected with the prior BESS-Polar I. The BESS-Polar II data offer a unique opportunity to identify and precisely measure H and He isotopes over a wide rigidity range, ~ 0.5 GV to ~4 GV. The BESS instrument has many outstanding hardware features, which enable precise measurements of cosmic-ray H, He, and their isotopes, in addition to antiparticles. Its long-duration-balloon flight drastically reduced statistical uncertainties, and it provides the most precise measurements of H and He isotope fluxes and secondary-to-primary ratios. The unprecedented precision of BESS-Polar II measurements together with other cosmic-ray data, can strongly constrain propagation models and their parameters. It also facilitates a sensitive study of cosmic-ray time variations, which contribute to our understanding of local conditions in the Heliosphere as well as modeling of particle fluxes and plasma conditions in the near-Earth environment. The long duration of the BESS-Polar II flight and stability of its detectors enable the study of transient time variations of hydrogen and helium isotope fluxes. Measurements of 2H and 3He isotopes along with their main parents 1H and 4He provide important information on both the Galactic and heliospheric propagation of cosmic rays, as well as a 'tracer' for antiproton calculations. Current propagation models will be evaluated using already reported antiproton/proton ratios together with the new 2H/1H and 3He/4He ratios. The proposed activities address NASA's 2010 Science Plan for SMD's Science Goals in Astrophysics and Heliophysics, specifically with the objectives to 'Understand the origin and destiny of the universe, and the nature of black holes, dark energy, dark matter, and gravity' and to 'Understand the fundamental physical processes of the space environment from the Sun to Earth, to other planets, and beyond to the interstellar medium'."}},

As such, the CAT engine is an enabling technology that supports NASA, commercial, university, and military CubeSat needs from constellation deployment to lunar orbit insertion and beyond. In the CAT engine, a high-power  RF plasma discharge is expanded adiabatically along a magnetic nozzle topology established by permanent magnets. A resultant ambipolar electric field accelerates the ions to high energies to generate thrust while retaining high propellant utilization. The CAT engine offers a means of providing efficient and high thrust-to-power primary propulsion for CubeSats and microsatellites. The CAT engine promises to change the CubeSat paradigm from passive sensor carriers to fully capable mission-completing spacecraft.

The model was designed for coupling to atmospheric numerical models. Consequently, there is a compromise between computational efficiency and the complexity with which the necessary atmospheric, ecological, and hydrologic processes are parameterized. The model is not meant to be a detailed micrometeorological model, but rather a simplified treatment of surface fluxes that reproduces at minimal computational cost the essential characteristics of land-atmosphere interactions important for climate simulations.

When coupled to an atmospheric model, the atmospheric model is the time-stepping driver.

Standard size separation methods for dry materials often depend on gravity as the primary body force. For separation of small sizes, gravity-force is usually supplemented with vibration and shearing flow. Granular materials naturally stratify during shear-flow with larger particles rising to the top. Depending on frequency and intensity, vibrations alone can induce large particles to rise to the top in a granular bed, independent of shear flow.  The proposed centrifugal size-separators utilize the natural size stratification of flowing granular solids. They will function equally well under reduced gravity conditions and in vacuum. The nominal design is a configuration with only one moving part and no blades, or other high-wear components. Shearing flow and vibrations combined with a size-separating screen at the outside (or 'bottom') of the flow will separate particles, with the fines passing through the outer wall screen, and the coarse material passing axially through the continuous feed system. Multiple size separation streams are possible. Alternate designs with shear-enhancing blades, 'above' or inside the screen, will also be evaluated. Various approaches for screen deblinding, and other robustness enhancements, are part of the proposed designs. With appropriate selection of passing-screen size, and deblinding enhancements, the centrifugal-sieves could be used for regolith processor feedstock conditioning to remove material > 0.5cm diameter, and with alternate settings and screen size, also used for a degree of beneficiation, to select particular size ranges that have the highest percentage of desired mineral content.

The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) program is a successful science CubeSat mission for the H-TIDeS LCAS program, and we propose to extend the MinXSS studies with a second launch in December 2016 with improved instrumentation for a new 4-year mission. The original MinXSS-1 mission objectives are to better understand the energy distribution of solar flare soft X-ray (SXR) emissions and its impact on Earth\u2019s ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere (ITM). These studies, currently funded through 2016, focus on the solar SXR variability of active region evolution and flares during the MinXSS-1 six-month mission, modeling of the solar SXR variability, and understanding how the solar SXR energizes Earth\u2019s ionospheric E-region (80-150 km). The MinXSS-2 mission with its longer 4-year life will extend these studies during the declining phase of solar cycle 24, cycle minimum, and the rising phase of solar cycle 25. MinXSS will enhance these original studies during these different solar cycle phases by characterizing the differences in (1) the active region heating / abundance, (2) flare energetics, and (3) solar forcing in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. METHODOLOGY. MinXSS is a solar-oriented, 3-axis-controlled, 3-unit CubeSat to observe the solar SXR spectrum between 0.6 and 30 keV (0.04 and 2 nm). The X-ray spectrometer on MinXSS has a nominal spectral resolution of 0.15 keV full width half maximum (FWHM). The capabilities of this X-ray spectrometer have been flight-proven on MinXSS-1 and also previously on sounding rocket flights in 2012 and 2013. An improved version of this X-ray spectrometer is on MinXSS-2. The other major technology on MinXSS is the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) from Blue Canyon Technologies (BCT); the BCT 0.5-unit ADCS has been flight proven on MinXSS-1 with precision solar pointing to ~10 arc-seconds. The MinXSS-1 was launched in December 2015 to the International Space Station (ISS) and deployed from the ISS on May 16, 2016. Starting from the ISS altitude of ~400 km, the MinXSS-1 mission life is only about 6 months. The MinXSS-2 spacecraft was built in parallel with MinXSS-1 and is being delivered to Spaceflight Industries in fall 2016 for its launch into a 500-km sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). This free ride-of-opportunity for MinXSS-2 from Google Terra Bella (formerly Skybox Imaging) was not planned in the original MinXSS program that only provides support for development of the MinXSS spacecraft and the MinXSS-1 mission through 2016. This proposal supports the new MinXSS-2 mission for two years (2017-2018) and an extended mission for two more years (or opportunity to be extended in the next Senior Review in 2017). As with MinXSS-1, closure on the science objectives involves comparisons with SDO and RHESSI measurements, ITM modeling using the NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM), and improvements to the empirical Flare Irradiance Spectral Model (FISM) that is used for a variety of space weather research applications. New for MinXSS-2 is the addition of comparative studies with Hinode and NuSTAR solar measurements, studies correlating the measured photospheric magnetic field flux to soft X-ray spectra, and physics-based modeling of the SXR spectra. We have added two more Co-Is for supporting the extra research, and we are also adding a second ground station at Geophysical Institute (GI) in Alaska for increasing the daily data downlink by a factor of six over MinXSS-1. We are willing to share LASP and GI ground stations with another NASA CubeSat."}},

The technique in accomplishing this is by fabricating the lens facesheet as the top most layers in the melting process.  This way, our melting technique in producing the best possible finish on the lens surface SLM can provide. If this is successful, then performing a electro-polishing of the substrate before nickel plating the lens facesheet, single point diamond turning (SPDT) is the only time it is necessary. By developing the SLM techniques having a facesheet ROC with minimum variation, and having an optimized facesheet thickness designed for additive manufacturing, this substrate can be scaled to support flight hardware designs for UVOIR mirrors."}},

Because of MAPS' previous flights on board the Space Shuttle, Earth system scientists now know that carbon monoxide concentrations in the troposphere are highly variable around the planet, and that widespread burning in the South American Amazon Basin and southern cerrados, the African savannahs,and the Australian grasslands and ranches are major sources of carbon monoxide in the southern hemisphere and tropical troposphere.InstrumentThe MAPS instrument is based on a technique called gas filter radiometry. Thermal energy from the Earth passes through the atmosphere and enters the viewport of the downlooking MAPS instrument. Carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere produce unique absorption lines in the transmitted energy. The energy which enters the MAPS instrument is split into & three beams. One beam passes through a cell containing CO and falls onto a detector. This CO gas cell acts as a filter for the effects of CO present in the middle troposphere. A second beam falls directly onto a detector without passing through any gas filter. The difference in the voltage of the signals from these two detectors can be used to determine the amount of CO present in the atmosphere at an altitude of 7-8 km. A third beam of the incident energy passes through a cell containing N2O and falls onto a detector. This N2O gas cell acts as a filter for the effects of N2O present in the atmosphere. The global distribution of N2O is well known, so the N2O signal can be used to detect the presence of clouds in the field of view and to correct the simultaneous CO measurement for systematic errors in the data. The data that are available from MAPS OSTA3 include a 5 by 5 degree gridded box (MAPS_OSTA3_5X5_HDF) and a second by second data product (MAPS_OSTA3_COSEC_HDF).

Accurate measurements of both atmospheric constituents are critical to the understanding of global energy transport and climate change. Under our Phase I program, Fibertek successfully demonstrated the capability of a new laser source, a diode-pumped frequency-doubled Er:YAG laser to generate millijoule output near 823 nm that was tunable through water-vapor absorption lines for DIAL measurements. The new laser system offers simplicity and efficiency that will reduce risk for future airborne and space-based missions. Significantly, the new laser approach offers an upgrade path with reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption over current state-of-the-art DIAL based on less-efficient non-linear parametric conversion of diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. This new-generation technology reduces the size and weight of flight hardware to make it compatible with affordable, more capable airborne and satellite payloads.

First HyperV will design, construct and test, in conjunction with UAH, a single fiber coupled X-ray scintillator pixel. Silicon Photo-multipliers will be investigated to maximize channel properties for the accepted cost and desired scalability. Next we will develope an X-ray imager of at least 16 pixels for observing X-ray backlit material flows based off of the single channel experiments. A camera performance of at least 2500 frames at 10 Megaframes per second with at least 12-16 bits per pixel will be targeted. X-ray emission from backlighter will be shone through a rocket motor and projected onto a scintillator. The optical emission from the scintillator is then observed by a fiber imaging grid. The imaging grid would then couple light to a bank of amplified SiPM pixels with integrated analog gain and data acquisition.  HyperV has already demonstrated as part of previous work a two clock domain technique for using slow cheap micro-controllers to manage high time resolution data acquisition over long record-length with a low cost digital backend. HyperV has also demonstrated that this back end can be used to observe SiPM as well as photodiode detectors.  We propose now to extend these techniques observe X-ray induced emission of scintillator materials for performing time resolved imaging of X-rays.

Such a mission will advance our understanding of the Solar System, exoplanetary systems, planetary formation and evolution. The IGPDS report identified twelve science objectives for ice giant exploration that are consistent with the Vision and Voyages Planetary Science Decadal Survey (NRC 2011). Highlighted in the report are two science objectives, of equal importance, that relate to the atmospheric (thermal) structure of these icy worlds: (i) determine the planet's atmospheric heat balance, and (ii) determine the planet's tropospheric 3-D flow. Key questions concerning the atmospheric structure arise: What are the altitudes/pressures and compositions of the cloud layers? How do the cloud layers interact with solar visible and planetary thermal radiation to influence the atmospheric energy balance? How does the energy balance contribute to atmospheric dynamics? Our unique Net Flux Radiometer (NFR) concept, onboard a probe descending deep into the atmosphere will contribute greatly to answering these questions by measuring the upward and downward radiation flux, in seven spectral channels, each with a 5-degree Field-Of-View (FOV) and in five sequential view (sky) angles as a function of altitude/pressure. \nWe will develop a prototype advanced Focal Plane Assembly (FPA) housed in a vacuum micro-vessel, a key sub-system of our NFR.

The vacuum micro-vessel is required to help mitigate the effects of rapid changes in temperature of the FPA that the instrument will experience during a probe descent into either a Uranus or a Neptune atmosphere. The FPA will be integrated with a fold mirror sub-assembly and assembled into a vacuum micro-vessel to mature this technology from TRL-2 to TRL-4.

Nanosatellites (i.e. spacecraft weighing less than approximately 10 kg) hold the promise of low-cost access to space and more rapid development. On the other hand, nanosatellites impose severe mass, volume, and power constraints that make cutting-edge science difficult without additional technology development. Such a technology development is the subject of this proposal, encompassing optical design, integrated simulation, and model-based systems engineering. The proposed payload would fly as part of ExoplanetSat, a 3U CubeSat space telescope designed to detect transiting Earth-size exoplanets bright, Sun-like stars. Specific activities to be performed as part of this program are the development of a composite focal plane array combining CMOS and CCD imaging sensors for guide star tracking and science measurements, respectively; optimizing the sensor for high performance in the absence of active thermal control; developing a custom lens to serve as the optical telescope element; and creating a new tool that facilitates model-based systems engineering (MBSE) for small satellites. This work is significant to NASA in that the proposed technology development will allow low-cost platforms (e.g. CubeSats) to conduct meaningful science within their strict size, mass, and power constraints.

Engineering the PC waveguide slow light device where the group index perturbation \u0394ng can be significantly increased to 170-200, which will provide a much shorter waveguide length needed to steer the beam.\u00a0\n2. The unequally spaced design is capable of providing the side-lobe suppression up to 35 and 50 dB, respectively as required in phase I and phase II. \u00a0This achievement is due to the design of non-overlapping sidelobes and the unequally coupled optical intensity of each element created by each subarray while maintaining a single steerable peak with the required IFOV and TFOV."}},

This data set distributes, for each of 66 map zones, a set of six raster files in GeoTIFF format. There is a detailed README companion file for each map zone. There is also an ArcGIS shapefile (mapping_zone_shapefile.shp) with the boundaries of all the map zones. A mosaic image of biomass at 240 m resolution for the whole conterminous U.S. is also included.Please read this important note regarding the differences of Version 2 from Version 1 of the NBCD 2000 data. With Version 1, in some mapping zones, certain land cover types (in particular Shrubs, NLCD Type 52) were missing from and unaccounted for in modeled estimates because of a lack of reference data. In Version 1, when landcover types were missing in the models, the model for the deciduous tree cover type was applied. While more woody vegetation was mapped, the authors think this had little effect on model performance as in most cases NLCD version 1 cover type was not a strong predictor of modeled estimates (See companion Mapping Zone Readme files). In Version 2, after renewed modeling efforts and user feedback, these previously unaccounted for cover types are now included in modeled estimates.All 66 mapping zones were updated with the previously unmapped land cover types now mapped. The authors recommend use of the new version for all analyses and will only support the updated version.Development of the data set used an empirical modeling approach that combined USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data with high-resolution InSAR data acquired from the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and optical remote sensing data acquired from the Landsat ETM+ sensor. Three-season Landsat ETM+ data were systematically compiled by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) between 1999 and 2002 for the entire U.S. and were the foundation for development of both the USGS National Land Cover Dataset 2001 (NLCD 2001) and the Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project (LANDFIRE). Products from both the NLCD 2001 (landcover and canopy density) and LANDFIRE (existing vegetation type) projects as well as topographic information from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) were used within the NBCD 2000 project as spatial predictor layers for canopy height and biomass estimation. Forest survey data provided by the USDA Forest Service FIA program were made available to the project under a national Memorandum of Understanding. The response variables (canopy height and biomass) used in model development and validation were derived from the FIA database (FIADB). Production of the NLCD 2001 and LANDFIRE projects was based on a mapping zone approach in which the conterminous U.S. was split into 66 ecoregionally distinct mapping zones. This mapping zone approach was also adopted by the NBCD 2000 project."}},

Based on recent success in demonstration of critical MMICs and ICs, Hittite proposes to apply its novel MMIC concept to design MMW signal sources for application in earth monitoring sensors.  Two different synthesizer architecture, one direct and one indirect, are proposed as candidate approaches.  In both cases, frequency synthesis will take place at about 1/8 of the output frequency and then translated up to the final output with a fixed tone. The proposed approach relies on components operating at lower frequencies for better phase noise performance, and the method is applicable to generation of higher frequencies. The proposed program will lead to a family of novel miniaturized MMIC products for commercial communications."}},

Hypersonic flight poses a wide array of difficulties, including significant guidance and control challenges.  For example, flexible airframes and highly integrated airframe and propulsion systems common in scramjet designs mean that aerodynamic and propulsion control are closely coupled.  Control laws for hypersonic vehicles must also handle a very broad range of dynamics as hypersonic vehicles often operate from subsonic through hypersonic speeds and possibly with multiple propulsion modes for different speed ranges.  Actuator saturation and significant models uncertainty also pose control challenges, and demanding energy management requirements make guidance and trajectory optimization challenging tasks as well.  The proposed research will develop innovative control strategies to address the challenges of hypersonic flight.  These will be based on recent advances in switching control methods that provide large stable regions and disturbance rejection guarantees in the presence of actuator saturation.  The proposed control methods will ultimately be integrated with advanced guidance approaches for hypersonic vehicles developed by Barron Associates."}},

The waveforms are collections of 4-bit samples of the electric field measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800 samples per second. 1600 samples are collected in 55.56 msec followed by a 4.44-msec gap. Each 60-msec interval constitutes a line of waveform samples. The data set includes about 271 frames of waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, each. The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as constructs in describing the form of the data. The waveform is sampled through a bandpass filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz. The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain control used in the waveform receiver. The instantaneous dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 db, but the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the instantaneous dynamic range. With the gain control, the overall dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 db. The automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data. However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained in most cases. The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the spacecraft. But the normal method of analyzing the waveform data is by Fourier transforming the samples from each line to arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum. By stacking the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency- time spectrogram can be produced. Additional information about this dataset and the instrument which produced it can be found elsewhere in this catalog. An overview of the data in this data set can be found in Gurnett et al.

The AIRS Only Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products.
