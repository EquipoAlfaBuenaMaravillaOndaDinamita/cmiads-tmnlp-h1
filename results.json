The first 2 were definitely 5 stars - this one lacked a little.  The hotel is remodeling their nicest garden rooms which was disappointing for us, but temporary.    And they take COVID safety to the extreme, which is appreciated and understood - but my family is much more relaxed about viruses.  We are clean and cautious but feel like mask requirements (constant reminders), temperature checks daily, and appointments for the swimming pool are extreme.  Especially the front desk temperature checks, since they scan temp and have a hand sanitizing station at the door every time you enter the property.  We spent 3 weeks in Antigua and frequented many different businesses...most were more relaxed about covid precautions than the hotel.   The restaurant food seemed to be slightly less appealing this time as well - although breakfast is excellent! \u2026"},

Rooms will not be cleaned or will be cleaned in the most inconvenient hours like 4-6 pm when you are trying to relax from exploring in the basking April sun . You sit by the pool , no one will ask you if you need anything, they will take 20-30 min for simple drinks and if you leave and tell them you are canceling the order , they will bring it to the wrong place .  My masks broke so I needed another one so I can keepmyself and everyone else safe , went to the lobby .. they couldn\u2019t give me one but they would sell me one .. I said fine .. it\u2019s Q5 .. then he goes .. we don\u2019t have  those anymore .. I can sell you a package of 14 .. I didn\u2019t need 14 .. just one so I left . They have movie night in the holiest of the weeks .. by the pool , quite loud and it\u2019s supposed to start at 6 pm .. but .. it\u2019s Guatemala so why not start at 4 pm and prevent people from just relaxing to the music of marimba or chirping birds .. I had to talk to the front desk so they would do movie night when they were supposed to be and to LET PEOPLE know that there will be movie night ; Jessica Solorzano\u2018s ( from customer service ) response was .. go somewhere else .  And yeah they put families and yappy dogs close to the Section with the small pool so .. can\u2019t relax anywhere here  .. they don\u2019t take any feedback and I think that\u2019s the worst thing about this hotel .  Never coming back . \u2026"},

They give you a box of masks, gloves and a bottle of hand sanitiser upon arrival, all the staff wear masks and gloves and the rooms and everything else are cleaned to the highest standard.

After a long airplane trip to Guatemala City with no hotel to arrive to, Porta was super attentive in getting us a room, making it available for early check in and helping us carry our bags to a beautiful garden double bed room with a view of the pool. My son loved the pool and the balcony view of the garden was so relaxing with many birds and parrots outside. In April, we stayed in a suite. Both rooms were enjoyed by my family. This hotel had some of the best coffee I had during my stay in Guatemala, in particular the bourbon coffee. The food was good, and the pina coladas were made with fresh pineapple juice. There is clean water in each room along with  toiletries. The suite even had small gifts. In case you want to try something different, there is a neat cafe nearby, the artista cafe, with delicious cappuccino and avocado toast. Overall a comfortable stay in Antigua, a nice walk to the plaza and mercado. I would stay here again because I will never forget the hospitable welcome I felt when I first arrived. \u2026"},

The level of detail that the staff had to work to make an unforgettable night was amazing.  I highly recommend the restaurant of this Hotel.  The food and variety are excellent. There are very few hotels in Antigua that allow dogs... so this one is excellent for pet lovers. Our service dog feels always at home whenever we visit Guatemala.  "},
