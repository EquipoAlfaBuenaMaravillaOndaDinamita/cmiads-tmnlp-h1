Excelent,"Excellent hotel, clean, safe and affordable!","We were pleased to stay in this excellent hotel which was clean, safe and affordable! We were able to conveniently take the Orange Line Metro from the airport after a long flight from San Francisco to our hotel after only a short walk.   The room and entire hotel were very clean and inviting.   The breakfast the next morning was superb.  It was a buffet near the reception area that was not crowded nor cluttered.  The guests could also eat in a quiet area near the beautiful pool.   This hotel looks out upon an architecturally restored elementary school in the bustling downtown Brickell area.     The reception personnel gave us their suggestions for finding a restaurant and we were well pleased with the results.   At breakfast the next day, other guests were also pleased w/ the"
Excelent,PLEASANTLY SURPRISED,"I was brought here by my fiancé for my surprise birthday weekend getaway. The price was awesome considering the location and it was not far from the beach areas. The parking was easier than it is explained on their website and the rooms were delightful. Because I am a Hilton Honors member we were awarded an upgrade at no additional fee. We were also greeted by the concierge very joyfully and with professionalism. The front desk was very nice and accommodating to us as I mentioned it was my birthday weekend. I loved everything about this hotel, down to the 6th floor pool. If you are worried about safety they have a security guard on the premises 24hrs a day so any time you are coming in or out you will see them. The security was extremely helpful in ensuring we could get in and"
Excelent,"Super clean, friendly staff and perfect location","This hotel was such a breath of fresh air for us. We had stayed in over 15 hotels during our cross country trip and just had left our first really bad experience in a hotel in Miami the night before, which was 3 times the price.   This property is luminous, pristine, well appointed and the staff was warm and professional. It has a corporate feel to it but does not feel cold at all. The suite is so clean and fresh looking. Everything is in the right place and more. We even decided to stay in for dinner. The bed and pillows were so comfortable, we had a hard time getting up in the morning.  The location could not be more perfect. We walked everywhere and saw everything we wanted to see in this beautiful neighbourhood, feeling right in the middle of it. The pool is small but very"
Excelent,"The Nicest Hampton Inn Anywhere! Superior Service, Location & Style","I rarely write reviews but this Hampton Inn is remarkable. My family stayed in two rooms this week for winter break. My wife and I had an updated and well appointed king suite and our 3 teenaged children stayed in a double queen room next door. Our suite had a sitting area for all of us to gather whenever needed and a work space that allowed me to comfortably work from the room. My kids loved going down to the pool, jacuzzi, and fitness center and we never missed the delicious breakfast options and fresh coffee each morning. I find it amazing that this Hampton Inn continues to be TripAdvisor's #1 rated hotel in Miami every year and I understand why. The staff at this hotel really care about you and the quality of your experience. The entire building and grounds are always clean,"
Excelent,Visiting family,"Excellent Service!!! This is by far the nicest Hampton Inn we have ever stayed at. The location, at check-in, the Front Office Manager, John Papazoglou, took care of us personally, he gave us a newly renovated room on the 16th floor. The mattress and bed sheets are so new that we didn’t want to get up every morning. Came to the Front Desk to personally thank Mr. PapZoglou the next day. Everyone has been very attentive and courteous , we are coming back in December, and we will definitely stay at this hotel again. Keep up the great service. Thank you for making our stay so pleasant. Sincerely, Anthony Crosby"
Excelent,A Safe and Welcoming Place in these crazy times,"We stayed 9 nights here while my husband had eye surgery at a nearby hospital. It was stressful to travel in the time of Covid and particularly with that medical emergency. But the hotel was well prepared for safe visits, with sealed rooms on arrival, and limited maid service when requested— but not daily, so we didn’t feel we were constantly exposed to unknown people in the room. We could have clean towels, more coffee, etc on request.  In fact, you could have daily service if desired...we just didn’t want that.The complimentary breakfast was served in a way that gave us a choice of light meals in containers that were then sealed and could be taken back to the room.  The staff was incredibly kind. The concierge was great and arranged to personally bring us a special dinner"
Very Good,Great Property for Downtown Miami,"I loved nearly everything about this hotel. The location was prime for downtown Miami. Our room was 1622 - fridge and microwave included. I like that our hotel key was required to get to our floor for safety reasons.  We were extremely close to the Metromover & Trolleys. We always felt safe walking to the store (7-11 or Publix) or from the Brickell station at night.  BUT, sand (actual sand from the the beach) was on the sheets when I pulled the comforter back. This made me question the cleanliness of our room. We had not gone to the beach and I was just turning the covers back.   I called the front desk immediately. New sheets were brought up. The young man at the desk apologized and offered to switch our rooms but it was a little after 10 p.m. and after a long day of travel, my"
Excelent,Fantastic Location and Delicious Breakfast!,"We had a great stay at this Brickell area Hilton family property. I picked it based on other reviews and the proximity to the AA arena. We came specifically for a concert and this hotel was within a 2 mile radius.   Rooms: We had a comfortable double room. The view was of the city and we had a quiet stay. The bathrooms have a tub and shower and plenty of towels. There are no refrigerators in the room just in case you need one. There is a coffee machine, safe, ice bucket, and tv. The toiletries are from Neutrogena.   Breakfast: Breakfast is included here and it was one of the nicest breakfast buffets I have seen at a Hampton Inn. The foods are so nicely presented with cucumber slices on the meats, crispy European breads and rolls, fresh cut tropical fruit and berries, and tasty"
Excelent,1 night stay pre cruise,"We checked in here after an international flight to stay one night before departing on a cruise.  The hotel is excellent.  We only had a short time the next morning to explore the area so can’t comment much on location, but there are restaurants and a publix very close by.  The hotel itself is exceptionally clean- especially the room, which was large and spacious.  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom excellent.  There is a coffee maker and fridge and microwave.  The breakfast that is included you also cannot fault - a great selection of hot and cold items and great coffee.  On check in we were given vouchers for a complimentary beer or wine which we enjoyed at the pool area.  The pool is small but otherwise the hotel is excellent and we would stay again"
Excelent,Beautiful and welcoming hotel experience!,"I've been staying at this Hampton Inn location every time I've visited Miami for the past 10 years and it delivers and impresses every time. The environment and decoration is trendy, fun, and inviting. Friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms, perfect locations. I travel with my family of 5 and all of us love it here. Truly something for everyone! Highly recommend."
Very Good,Great Staff Great Location,Great location for staying in the Brickell area Staff are all very helpful and courteous. Room was clean. Bathroom floor clean but whatever product was used leaves the floor a bit sticky. No big deal if you wear slippers. 
Excelent,Great stay at Hampton Inn Miami Brickell.,"We spent two days at this Hampton after a two week cruise. We wanted to see Miami after many years of just passing through. First the negatives. They are in the middle of a major remodel, so if you are there for leisure, forget about taking a nap in the middle of the day. There is a great deal of noise from around 9:30 am until 6 pm week days. This may be the case until December 2021. Additionally, the hot tub is broken and will be until they can get a part which still could take several more weeks. As for the positive, Nikki who was acting as concierge, and John P., front office manager, are two of the nicest people you will ever meet. They went out of there way to make us feel welcome and assist us in any way they could. The new rooms are beautiful ( we stayed in one) and will"
Very Good,4 night stay,"Enjoyed our stay just ten minutes walk to town centre and places to eat,easy reach for mono rail which runs every few minutes and it’s free.Arrived at hotel just in time for free buffet and beer or wine witch was very handy .room was very nice with separate bedroom didn’t hear any noise at all. Only thing my husband wasn’t happy about was being told off for looking though door that was wide open and unattended we thought it was the stairs, nobody spoke to us or said good morning which made us feel uncomfortable."
Excelent,Perfect location. Amazing service. ,"We stayed at this Hampton inn during a vacation in Miami and found it to be perfect in every way. The location is close to everything but far enough from the noise to get a good night's rest.  The level of service and convenience from the courtesy parking at check-in process to the multi level front desk during peak hours, nothing is overlooked.  The lobby on the 6th floor is exclusively appointed and unlike any other Hampton inn.  Friendly service, well equipped rooms great amenities, parking with in and out privilege make this a top choice for a stay in Miami. "
Excelent,The perfect 5 nights,"I stayed with 2 others in an Elite Level room, not having stayed in a Hampton Inn hotel before. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, especially the room maid who kept it spotless and well stocked. Free bar drinks. Very comfortable room. Perfect for transport links on the doorstep. The breakfast was out of this world with an amazing choice. We were all blown away by the hotel and want to stay again just for the stay!"
Excelent,Center of downtown .,We booked this hotel for 1 night for a cruise but the cruise got cancelled and we ended up staying here for 4 nights . Restaurants around hotel are very pricey you can walk around the area lots of stores and places to go close to the metro mover I think that's what it was called  . The free breakfast was very well planned everything in a bag for breakfast you could want . great staff and nice pool area also . parking around the area is a issue use the garage for a fee .
Very Good,Great location and comfortable,"We were very well received and the check in process was quick.  Our room was spacious and clean.  Beds are comfortable.  The A/C and noise from the hallway was a bit loud but not terrible. a grab and go breakfast and wifi are complimentary.  Parking for guests is $28 but with your hotel key, you can enter and exit as needed. The local makes it easy to walk to many restaurants and downtown buildings."
Average,Just okay,"Breakfast could have been much better. I work in the food industry, and for the price we paid for the room they could of cooked breakfast and put in packages. The rooms were not what the pictures shows that you would get for the prices we paid."
Excelent,Amazing hotel,"What an awesome hotel! The location is great! The service was wonderful! Since the pandemic, you can tell it had an impact on housekeeping services for hotels. We also stay at Hilton properties all time, and we have had some issues that we didn’t have prior to the pandemic. I must say that this hotel housekeeping services were excellent! We were extremely satisfied. We read the reviews prior and decided to give it a try. I’m so glad we did!"
Excelent,Miami Art Weekend,"Our stay was amazing. The room was beautiful, impeccable clean and very spacious. All the staff was welcoming, from the check inn personal to the breakfast staff. Mrs. Luz at the breakfast area was always super attentive and with Christopher they always made sure we had the best start of our day.  We also loved the location, easy walk every night to great restaurants and the mall is 2 blocks away.  We will definitely be back to the Hampton Inn at Brickell !"
Excelent,Excellent Hampton Inn & Suites Brickell ,"This by far is the nicest, cleanest and most up to date Hampton Inn I’ve ever stayed in. Front Desk staff were very customer service friendly and made it a point to welcome you.  The Operational Manager Victoria Greber had her desk up front and interacted with guests and helping the staff with check outs. She was available for questions and had a very pleasant and welcoming attitude about her.  The hotel was spotless !! Staff was continually wiping down and cleaning public areas.  The rooms were fresh, crisp, clean and up to date !! The breakfast staff (the two women) were outstanding !! They remembered me from the previous visits. They greeted each and every guest with a smile and a good morning, they went out of their way to accommodate people’s requests. I highly recommend"
Excelent,Perfect Stay,This hotel exceeded my expectations on every level. My husband and I traveled with our teenagers who stayed next door to our king suite in their own double queen room. The newly renovated rooms were meticulously clean and very comfortable. Our kids enjoyed the pool and hot tub daily (and nightly!) and we were able to walk out the front door of the hotel and enjoy the restaurants and shops in the trendy Brickell neighborhood.  I enjoyed my morning coffee (available 24 hours/day in the lobby) in the shade off the pool deck in comfy cushioned chairs. Free buffet breakfast for all 5 of us was much appreciated as it helped save us the cost of that meal every day. The staff was welcoming and very helpful. I highly recommend this hotel!
Excelent,Another visit,"We have stayed here before and had a good experience. We came back for our first Covid vaccine reservation and this experience went from good to great. The hotel was immaculate our room felt clean. What impressed us most of all was the elevators were clearly marked for three people only. Beyond the interior of the elevator  being marked, they had signs clearly posted at the elevator doors with graphics and wording about the three people policy. There was no avoiding the three person to an elevator expectation.  Breakfast was very well handled and the food attendant could not have been nicer. You knew she liked her job.  So nice.  We are scheduled for our second vaccine in a few weeks and our room is already booked at the Hampton Inn Brickell"
Excelent,Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton Miami Brickell Downtown,"Perfect, safe downtown location for a stay in Miami. Restaurants and Publix (supermarket) near by. Convenient parking garage next door. Clean, fresh, modern and spacious rooms with newer comfy beds. Professional, friendly and engaged staff. Great American breakfast with awesome waffle making station, also catering to the EURO - cruise line traveller offering wider selection of cheeses and cold cuts. Family friendly Good value for money considering hotel category, location & amenities. Will definitely return."
Excelent,Our favorite Hotel on our way to somewhere else,"we have traveled several time to South America and we seem to always get routed through Miami. The Hampton Inn is where we always stay since is reasonably priced, in a good location, and the service is always exceptional. When we stayed a couple of weeks ago, I left a book on the bedside stand and the hotel returned it to our home promptly at their expense. The included breakfast is very good as well. You can't go wrong staying here."
Very Good,Good Stay,"An all around well-managed facility. Much more attractive than the drab entry would lead you to expect. Bright, clean and well planned common areas. Good security . Nice small pool and hot tub with a bar for happy hour.  Room was exceptionally well appointed, good lighting and layout.  There was an AC prob first nite that sounded like a commercial vac was running thru the ducts  the middle of the night(so no sleep). Resolved by the second nite. Front desk staff was not particularly friendly and acted like they were doing us a HUGE favor granting a 30 minute later checkout. We are Diamond members and expect better. Later discovered we could have paid a (smallish) sum to extend our stay several hours, this option was.  not offered.  There is an open air pub affiliated with the"
Excelent,Best Hampton Inn Ever,"The reviews speak for themselves. We stayed here for two days before a cruise out of Miami. This Hampton Inn had a great location on a quiet street, but was short walk away from nightlife, restaurants and ocean. Main floor 6 was a perfect place to relax or get a drink and the pool was lovely.  The breakfast was better than usual with more fruits and healthy options.  I would stay here every time I am in Miami. Thank you everyone."
Excelent,Roomy and great services,"The Hampton Inn suites at Brickell in Miami was quite a nice hotel for its category. The room was very roomy and had a coffee maker and fridge as well as a safe. Breakfast was included and even though it was not top notch it certainly had a great variety. Hot coffee was available 24 hours a day. The concierge and reception services were very good and the location of the hotel was in a very attractive area with plenty of restaurants to choose from. The metro stop was half a block away. All in all a highly recommended hotel even though the looks from outside are nothing fantastic, but inside is where the jewel is."
Very Good,Great pre-cruise hotel,"I stayed here for a night prior to my cruise in October and December 2019.  Room was comfortable.    Enjoyed a free drink at the bar as a Hilton Diamond Member.   I didn't try the complimentary breakfast so can't comment on it.  They offer transport to the Miami cruise port for a fee that was very reasonable.  The gym was great, clean, and had all the needed equipment.  2 thumbs up!"
Very Good,Great value and good location,"We spent two nights here after a cruise.  Since we arrived from the cruise in the morning, we waited in the large and comfortable 6th floor lobby until our room was ready at noon.   I chose this hotel because it was a more affordable option that was a short Lyft ride to the activities and tours I wanted to take.  It is an excellent value, because it has a full hot breakfast and no resort fee.  There are so many restaurants within walking distance that we had difficulty choosing.  The room and bathroom were large and clean, and I loved the thick towels.  The beds were absolutely heavenly.  I would definitely consider this hotel if I return to Miami."
Very Good,Great stay!,"We stayed here for 4 nights in January prior to a Disney cruise. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay here again. The staff were very friendly and helpful, from check in to concierge. The hotel included breakfast every day and it was delicious and filling. It had everything from eggs, breakfast meats, waffles, cereal, fresh fruit, toast, pastries, juice, smoothies, and even lunch meats. There is a Starbucks right down the street and several other restaurants within walking distance. The concierge recommended a pizza place around the corner and we walked over and picked up a pizza and took it back to the room one night. The Metro Mover is a free transportation system in Miami and it is within walking distance from the hotel. The concierge gave us step by step"
Very Good,Pre-cruise Hotel,Front desk was great!!! Check in was fast and friendly. Room was clean and comfortable.  Location was great for precruise because we could walk to a store to purchase wine and there were a lot of restaurant options nearby. There was shuttle service to our port (I think it was $8-$10 pp but don’t quote me). Area was safe and walkable. There was free breakfast... it wasn’t horrible but it wasn’t great. However it was convenient to start our day prior to heading to our ship.  I would definitely consider this hotel again for a Miami cruise.
Excelent,Awesome Staff and Stay,"Just wanted to send a big THANK YOU to Nikkiea for making our stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites (Hilton Miami Brickell Downtown) over the holidays such an AWESOME experience.  Although we’re not new to the Miami area, it was the first time staying downtown at this hotel.  The hotel and staff are exceptional however, my wife and I truly appreciated the extra time/attention we received from Nikkiea.  We have been Hilton Honors members since ~ 2002 and Nikkiea definitely made this one of our best experiences to date.  We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the downtown Miami area!  Thank you again for everything Nikkiea and continue the great work!  Hope to see you in the future!"
Excelent,A Gem Among Miami Hotels,"I just had to take a moment to recognize Sales Manager, Christina Delaney, of the Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton Miami-Brickell/Downtown. While making travel arrangements for a group that regularly travels to Miami in the spring, I was transferred to Ms. Delaney for assistance with our booking. She went above and beyond in making sure our multiple room reservation was accurate according to our preferences. Additionally, she was so willing to work with us to ensure ease during the check-in process.  Ms. Delaney demonstrates such professionalism, exceptional customer service, and the most refreshing disposition of any hospitality representative I have ever come across. I am speaking as someone who makes a tremendous amount of travel arrangements each year. She is incredibly"
Very Good,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights before our cruise.  Was allowed the room earlier which was a bonus, room was clean, wifi was good.  We paid extra for higher floor room, where there were free snacks, robe etc included and bed turn down, which to be honest we didn't like. We were there two nights but only received the one nights free snacks which I felt a bit mean with us being there two nights. We also got a drinks voucher for one free drink each on both nights. Husband was given a plastic cup with his wine in, and when he asked for it to be in a glass barman moaned and said they were all used but husband asked him to wash one which he did regrudingly. The night after husband asked for a glass of rose wine and was told that wasn't included in the free deal, so he asked for a red wine"
Excelent,Top notch!,This Hampton Inn has all the trappings of a higher end brand.  Service is truly outstanding.  I had a glitch (noisy neighbors) the first night (rather very early morning).  Victoria at the Front Desk handled it professionally and fairly.  She is a true professional and the entire team is committed to providing the best service.  Nikkia downstairs (street level) lobby was also very helpful with recommendations.  Breakfast was very good and there is plenty of space to sit with social distancing.  We were upgraded to an Elite Floor.  Good size room and amenities.  Very clean and comfortable hotel throughout.  Great location in Brickell with perfect access to public transportation and restaurants. Congratulations!!!!
Excelent,One of the best,"I stayed for 2 days of business and 2 for leisure and am so glad I chose this hotel. It's no wonder they win the awards they do! From the moment you step out of the elevator someone is greeting you from the front desk. And even during an uncontrollable power outage the staff was calm, cool, and collected. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the complimentary breakfast was good. A special shout out to Dee-andra and Victoria (Tory) for assisting with my questions and stay. I often stay in south beach when I travel to Miami but may reconsider and just rent a car because this was by far some of the best service I've encountered in quite some time. Thank you! "
Very Good,Nice hotel,"Stayed two nights prior to a cruise.  We were happy with our stay overall. Great location with many other places within walking distance. The metro mover is within a block and is a good, free way to get to other areas for free. Breakfast on site was very good both mornings we tried it. As mentioned, City Center and Bayside Mall are easy to get to from the hotel."
Very Good,Great location for cruising,Stayed here the night before we were suppose to cruise. We came in late the same day that cruise lines were canceling because of the Corona virus. There was a bit of a problem because they had let a guest stay in the room that we had reserved and they didn't have any more of that class. They did give us another room with a rollaway bed though. They also comp'd the kids some snacks and the adults some drinks at the bar. The location is great if you are going on a cruise. Close to the port and easy to find transportation. The lobby bar and pool are good. The complimentary breakfast is decent. Would stay here again.
Excelent,Staff & location,"We were warmly greeted by  (? Name, Lucia?) although we arrived early. We decided to upgrade to rest before discovering the city. parking the rental was easy, the breakfast food was served by kind staff and was substantial (something for everyone). The coffee in the room was excellent- yum.  After our rest, we were greeted by name as we passed through the lobby- wow, we felt like the rich and famous!  I highly recommend this hotel. It is close to so much, so no car is necessary."
Average,Great Location ,We had an excellent experience with the staff until our final night. I had three staff members ensure I would not get lost taking public transit to south beach but the last night we came in late and the front desk girl was condescending.  The breakfast was AMAZING and the rooms were clean. I do have to say that although the location was great we would not stay at this hotel again. We could not adjust the air to our preference. There are limits on the settings and the 70 degrees felt like 78.    
Excelent,Stay before Cruise,"This really is a great Hampton inn.  The room was the nice and clean like I have learned to expect from a Hampton inn.  What stood out was the larger spread for breakfast, the bar and the outdoor pool, and ease to get there from airport.  We did take a Lyft from airport only because it was at night and I wasn't sure how safe the walk was from the train station, but saw it would not have been an issue.  The location was great for walking around in the evening and finding restaurants and seeing the ocean.  We were also able to get quick and cheap Lyft ride to cruise port in the morning."
Excelent,Amazing stay,"We had an amazing stay at this hotel. The staff was so nice and helpful. The breakfast was very nice. The location is also perfect since it’s so close to transportation and centrally located. We would also like to thank again Sony who was at the bar for his delicious cocktails for our last night there, he was so friendly and we loved speaking with him. This hotel sure is the place to stay in Miami"
Excelent,Awesome Hotel Experience,"The room was spacious and clean, the shower and tub are huge, the hotel is quiet and the breakfast was the best free buffet breakfast we’ve had. The hotel was walking distance to different restaurants amd centrally located to attractions that made it an easy drive. Great experience! We would definitely stay here again."
Excelent,"Great location, amenities and service","For a chain hotel this was anything but standard. While the rooms were what you would expect (clean, simple amenities, comfortable beds and quiet at night!), the rest of the hotel had tons of character. Staff were almost all friendly (bar staff were a little chilly), the free breakfast the best I have had at a chain hotel including lots of options hot and cold, free drinks/snacks for Hilton members, free 24 hour coffee/tea/fruit, fast wi-fi and a comfortable pool area/whirlpool. Hotel well-maintained except for slow clean-up on pool deck (where my mother and I had drinks and the glassware still hadn't been removed when we returned 3 hours later). Fantastic location close to all 3 forms of public transport, NYE events at Bayfront park, ocean walking path and restaurants. Would"
Excelent,Great overall experience,Upon arrival we were greeted with friendly staff and a manger with superior customer service skills.  Our room was not ready and he compensated us a drink while we waited.  He took time to recommend local establishments for dinner and a rooftop bar for drinks that were both wonderful options we enjoyed very much!  He checked us out in the morning and verified our satisfaction.  He gave us his business card and said if we traveled again to email him and he would set us up and take care of us.  His staff was courteous and responsive and rooms were very clean.  Would highly recommend the hotel and recognize Javier Gonzalez for his leadership!
Very Good,Still excellent value,"We stayed here several years ago when the hotel was nearly brand new.  Miami can be so expensive, so this is still a good option.  It is somewhat more reasonable and offers good value with attractive junior suites, good service and a expansive breakfast buffet.  I did find the bed to be far too hard for me on this trip.  I wish that they could provide foam toppers - and admittedly I forgot to try to request one.  The Brickell area is a great non-beach place to stay with some good walking and nice places to eat."
Excelent,Phenomenal Service,"My stay this past weekend at the Hampton Inn & Suites was great. It started off absolutely chaotic.  From delayed and canceled flights to long waits I expected this trip to be terrible BUT I happened to call the hotel ahead of time to confirm my accommodations and get help with checking in using the digital key. I spoke with Nakkea and she went ABOVE AND BEYOND to make sure that my friends and I got to the hotel safely and checked in. My friend arrived after Nakkea's shift ended but she stayed and made sure we were checked in and didn't need anything.  Everytime I called the hotel she promptly answered and helped me. The hotel itself is beautiful,  clean, and located in a wonderful part of downtown but the absolute best part of my trip was the staff.  Every person I came into"
Excelent,Great location in Miami,This hotel is 1/2 block from the Miami Metromover which is free and can get you to Bayside or Brightline. I attended a conference and spent much less than I would have at the host hotel and had a great room. Neighborhood is great with many excellent food options.
Terrible,Unfriendly staff and terrible management,"So i arrived at almost 3pm their usual check-in time a receptionist said oh we don’t have a room ready for you and i was like how?? I have a paid reservation can you explain when will i get the room, the Manager interrupted and said sorry we don’t know when but go to the lobby and will call you when it’s ready.. an hour and half later the manager came and said the room is ready i told her am sorry I don’t like how you guys dealt with the situation you didn’t even try to apologize.. How arrogant is that guests should at least be dealt with decently to feel welcome at least!! I canceled my booking and tool my wife and my baby to another hotel who can simply understand what hospitality is!! Definitely I don’t recommend to anyone specially to families.."
Excelent,"Great location for business, food n’ cruise","The recently remodeled rooms are roomy, clean and comfortable. Recommend for business or couples. A lot of great restaurants, shopping, grocery stores and people mover in walking distance.  Free EV/Tesla chargers. Park and cruise packages."
Excelent,Is this is an excellent Hampton Inn hotel!,"My husband and I stayed here for 6 nights in February and we had a great time! The staff was friendly and the service was excellent. Very clean hotel, not much noise for being downtown it was fairly quiet, the breakfast was great and they had a wonderful indoor breakfast area as well as very nice outdoor seating and pool area.  It was very safe and is located next to the metro rail, metro mover and trolley's.  Location is absolutely excellent and lots of dining right nearby. We felt very safe at this hotel also and they have a security guard there always at the front of the hotel.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to others and we would definitely stay there again ourselves!"
Excelent,Comfy and secure,"We were one of the 'lucky' couples whose cruise cancelled due to COVID-19.  The Hampton provided a place of comfort and security while we made arrangements to return home two days later. The pool was a nice treat, comfortable chase lounges, refreshing fruit flavored water, close distance to all sorts of eating establishments (this was before social distancing was enforced).  Internet was great and beds are fantastic. "
Very Good,BEST LOCATION IF VISITING BRICKELL.  VERY PLEASED WITH THIS CHOICE,"Had originally booked at a Hyatt but their pool closed so I wanted to rebook.  Decided to go with Hampton Inn based on studying maps of where most restaurants etc. are in Brickell and I was extremely happy with the choice.  The location is terrific.  The property is very very decent.  They have self parking for $25 a night.  Not too high for the area.  There are a few parking spaces you can use for unloading while going to check in.  No bell hops but saw racks you can borrow.  Reception is on the main floor which is 6 and everybody very professional.  Very nice room, much better than I saw on website.  Good size, very clean, plenty of hot water.  A basic buffet breakfast.  Not gourmet but coffee is pretty good and enough choices to hold you over for a while.  If visiting"
Very Good,Solid choice,"Shows better than your typical Hampton Inn. High rise property in general good condition/repair. Close to subway transit, 20 min to airport, easy check-in, middle of Brickell area (plenty of walkable restaurants/activities). Check in smooth. Room furnishing OK (microwave/frig in room). Bedding comfortable. Somewhat small windows. Bathroom spacious and well lighted. Wifi worked well. Pool is relatively small. Rooms not serviced during Covid and breakfast is a takeway bag (often long line). Checkin/out easy."
Excelent,Love ms nicki,Ms nicki was the best she made sure that my husband and I had the best treatment.Her hospitality was out of this world will be coming back soon. She answered all of our questions and even called to make sure we sure we were fine 
Excelent,Will stay here again!,"Stayed here after attending an afternoon ballgame, 15 minutes away.  Great place.  Looked new.  Very clean; friendly staff.  LOTS of restaurants around.  Nearby walk to the ocean, albeit not the beach.  Wonderful, albeit typical, breakfast in the morning:  fix-your-own waffles, eggs, sausages, potatoes, cereals, etc.  Plenty of parking in hotel and across the street.  Hotel has 4 or 5 charging stations, too."
Poor,Needs work,"We stayed at this hotel over the weekend. During that time, the hot tub never got hot, the towels by the pool were never refilled, the pool bar doesn’t open until 5pm but the pool closes at dusk. The rooms have not gotten the remodel to match the level of the common areas but the common areas were beautiful. "
Very Good,Nice stay at Brickell! Very friendly staff,"By the downtown, very lively city center. Close to very nice restaurants. Hotel is what you need from a hotel, comfortable, safe, reliable. Extra is the friendly staff. Newly renovated rooms are good. Has a private parking, 28 USD per night- convenient for Miami. COVID precautions are well known by staff- most of the staying people were wearing face masks too. Breakfast is ok, could be better. Covid-19 made the hotel breakfasts unpleasant, nothing to blame on the hotel."
Excelent,In the Heart of Brickell Miami ,"We booked this hotel due to the proximity to my daughter’s condo and also to the cruise port.  I enjoyed our 2 nights at the hotel so much due to the close proximity to restaurants, shops, Publix and Whole Foods!!!  Given the large amount of travelers during the holiday season,  the morning breakfast buffet was quite crowded.  I’m sure it’s pretty normal so we will need to wake up a bit earlier to beat the crowd.  Overall experience was fantastic!! We received free drink vouchers for our Gold Member status.  We truly appreciate it since it was least expected!!  Thank you Hilton!!  "
Excelent,good location near all stations,"Good hotel. The food for breakfast is American style, for my life was difficult. It was tasty but not healthy. My kids like it but my life eats only fruits:) Near the hotel was a free ride stations for bus and train, so you can go everywhere at the city for free. We use Uber and Lift and with some exception was OK. The neighborhood is business, quite and safe. Our friend prefer Miami beach but this hotel is new, more comfortable and near supermarket and pharmacy."
Excelent,A MUST Stay,"The hotel is beautiful, clean, spacious and located in the heart of downtown, Miami; close to the best restaurants that you need to dine. Hotel is also close to South Beach, offers free breakfast, free drinks and snacks. WE LOVED IT as a family!"
Very Good,Jackie was so Helpful!!,The hotel itself was nice and really efficient staff. However afterwards I had a problem with valet charges (hotel charged me for 3 cars instead or 2). Later I called customer service and a staff member named Jackie was super kind and helpful. She helped me sort everything out and got my refund with no problems at all! Thank you so much again Jackie you were amazing!! I will definitely be coming back.
Excelent,The Friendliest Staff Ever,"Wow, I was blown away with my stay.  I was checked in by John (OverNight shift) & he made my check in process a smooth breeze. The morning team (Nyykia, Victoria, Jonathan, Nathan) THANK YOU GUYS for being so amazing, helpful, accommodating, and super-friendly. Breakfast was great, plenty options for everyone in the family.Room was comfortable, bright, and well stocked with towels, blankets, extra pillow, shampoo, cap, conditioner, and much more."
Excelent,"Perfect, once again","This hotel is perfect if you need to be in downtown Miami. It is near everything in Brickell surroundings, and if you need to go to downtown, the mover station is half block away. The hotel is very good, and the staff is always ready yo help."
Excelent,Miami Cruise Ship Stay,"Wonderful hotel for a family. We stayed the night prior to our cruise departure. Hotel was clean, the room was huge, plenty of space for all of our luggage and to spread out.  We used the pool, which was clean and easy to access. Our teenagers worked out in the fitness center which had several cardio machines, free weights, and lifting machines.  The breakfast area was clean, well stocked, and food was fresh. Close proximity to great restaurants and night life. Overall it was a wonderful stay and we will be booking our stay again.  We only had one mishap with a teen getting stuck in an elevator because her cell phone room key was not working. "
Excelent,Relocation visit,"We moved to Miami from Mexico City as part of my job’s relocation.  We were housed the first two weeks here while I got basics for my new and current home just one block away. Today, I see this hotel from my terrace.  My office is also just four blocks away.   Great hotel.  We were surprised as I travel (pre Covid) often on business. Our Miami house hunting trip housed us at Four Seasons.  We appreciated the free breakfast, reasonable pricing for food and drinks, newspaper and service all around that was excellent.   Great front desk, security guards, barmen, servers, housekeepers.   We stiil credit this hotel with our success in feeling confortable as we relocated.  "
Very Good,Value for money,"The hotel was clean, well-run, and with friendly and helpful staff. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. Due to Spring Break there were some rowdy and intoxicated guests, but the hotel dealt with them in a professional manner to avoid any disturbance for other guests."
Excelent,Weekend Getaway,"Stayed at this hotel for a weekend at the end of February. The room was clean and neat. I expected some noise since we stayed during the weekend but it was nice and quiet with slight outdoor noise. The restaurants around the restaurant were great. We had dinner at the Cuban restaurant and the gastro pub. It is very convenient to have such great options down stairs. The only issue I had was we booked the FL resident rate room and received none of the perks of booking that room. The free parking was the highlight, but the desk attendant only gave us half off. Other than that, it was a great stay and would stay there again. "
Very Good,Great location/price ratio,"Within a week we stayed here and in another nearby hotel priced very similar. This hotel was better in all aspects location, rooms, public areas and service. The staff is super friendly and also they offer shuttle service to the port of miami with a fee. "
Excelent,A superb hotel,"My family and I had a very pleasant stay at the  Hampton Inn. The rooms were very clean & spacious. Very friendly and helpful staff who couldn’t do enough for us. A great free shuttle service will take you anywhere within a mile of the hotel!    My only criticism is the use of disposable cups, plates and plastic knives, forks and spoons at breakfast. But that seems to be the norm in most American hotels theses days!"
Excelent,Excellent Service,"The room was clean , service was excellent and the staff was very accomodating.Close to all amenities . Check in was easy and we were able to check in our luguage effortlessly . The Manager Lucas helped us with booking in and helping with finding the local shops - Business centre accessible.  Breakfast was good although busy due to Holiday season."
Very Good,Night before our cruise.,Overall a pleasant stay. Not a very reasonable value for one night stay. Little pricey. I love the cleanliness and helpfulness at the Hampton's but the price is a little much. I will continue to stay at an hampton when available but i do wish being a honors member would help make our stay more of a value. 
Excelent,Perfect for NYE celebrations,"We stayed here for 1 night over New Year’s Eve 2019/20 and it was an easy back from the Bayfront area where the fireworks were which is why we chose this hotel. The hotel was fresh and elegant, nicely decorated and a good layout. For NYE, we received a free alcoholic drink in the bar. A nice touch! The staff were as friendly and welcoming as you expect in Miami. Nearby there is shopping, restaurants, transport and anything else you to make your stay in Miami perfect!"
Very Good,"Convenient, clean, comfortable","This centrally located hotel was a nice find in the city.  Just south of downtown, easy access to Miami Beach and Little Havana.  There was a nice happy hour with a complimentary drink each and breakfast was actually quite nice for a buffet."
Excelent,Modern,"As a Hilton member, I really enjoyed staying here. It’s very clean and modern and located in a great in Downtown Miami. The staff was very friendly and it was super easy to check in and out using the app. I would definitely recommend staying here."
Excelent,Best bargain Downtown Miami,"This property is located one short block from Brickell Ave and is adjacent to the best restaurants, bars and walking area of Mary Brickell Village. The front desk staff are efficient and very friendly, particularly Victoria. Best value for your business or vacation dollar in this part of town."
Excelent,Very pleasant experience overall,"We loved the cleanliness of every space in the hotel. Bright and tastefully decorated. Most delighted in the staff, all friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. Ms. Greber at the desk was one of the loveliest people you could have the pleasure of dealing with. So absolutely genuine and kind. She went above and beyond. She truly enjoys her job! "
Excelent,A hotel you would want to book again and again,"We can not stop talking about how amazing our stay at The Hampton Inn & Suites was and how much we enjoyed our stay. This location lives up to its reviews. The staff was terrific, and the rooms/amenities were spotless and beautiful. Thank you for being accommodating and making the booking process easy and enjoyable. We will be staying here again and referring The Hampton Inn to other folks."
Excelent,"Clean, convenient & courteous!","I am very happy with my stay at this Hampton Inn! The location is great, the staff is so nice and the room was VERY clean.  The manager asked more than once how our stay was going and everyone was very friendly.  The hotel is family friendly and within walking distance of Starbucks & several great restaurants.  We will be back again! "
Average,Great location but overpriced,"Nice enough hotel but overpriced, especially if you choose the ""elite"" floor. There was no actual benefit for this, except we got 2 free waters. We found out from an elevator advertisement that it was supposed to come with drink tickets and had to ask for them.   It does have an excellent location and easy access to the Metromover to the left when exiting the hotel. If you exit to the right to the next street, there are a ton of restaurants. Do not go to the Asian restaurant next door, 3 Chefs. Two out of four of us got sick. "
Excelent,Really fantastic family hotel,"We arrived here just at the start of the pandemic, in early March.  We were nervous about travelling, but everything about this hotel put us at ease.  The room and common areas are impeccable, the pool area was a lot of fun, food was great and we felt welcomed!  This is our ""go to"" hotel in Miami from now on.  Location is great, its a little quiet but walking distance to the action."
Excelent,very nice hotel in great location,"This hotel is so close to all kinds of transportation. People mover, metrorail stops are very close. There is a Publix grocery store about 2 blocks away. The room we had was recently renovated with a large window. The hotel is usually full of cruise ship passengers coming and going. Not this time. The hotel was about empty. The staff were very gracious."
Excelent,Welcoming and comfortable hotel,"Well located, welcoming friendly staff. Good location, very comfortable, quiet. Nothing to fault it. 10 Mon stroll to the ocean. Underline Station to airport close hy. Great gastro pub under hotel too. Hotel reception is on the 6th floor. Stayed on 14th  very quiet and goof air con and shower etc. Nice bar and coffee facilities. Helpful reception staff. Recommended."
Excelent,Excellent experience,"Very good location, comfortable and spacious rooms with good buffet breakfast.  The personnel were very kind and helpful and were always there to assist you.  Next time we visit Miami, we will definitely stay there again. "
Excelent,Great place to Sleep on the way to Key West,"Great location between Everglades and Key West.  Nice hotel.  Great room.  Very clean,  people of front desk really helpful. We had to do our laundry and they were replacing the washers from the hotel so they helped us do it next door. Large parking area, swiming pool Good shower"
Excelent,Excellent stay,"Great location; walkable to everywhere, next to train station (airport and else) and metro mmover station (Broikell Line), near to restaurants, Publix market, etc. Nice room: cepacious, clean, quite, high floor and nice view. Good breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff especially Victoria (Reception) and Vivian (Breakfast). This is NOT our first stay and w'll definitely come back."
Poor,Com certeza não é Categoria e Padrão Hilton!,"I can't believe I'm staying at a Hilton Hotel! I've never seen anything like this in terms of bad service! At Check-in we were attended by the employee Deidre with no courtesy, bad temper and no manners - no training by the Hilton? Today at 5:05 PM, our room still hadn't been cleaned. Again we spoke to the receptionist Deidre, who simply said that she had ""nothing"" to do. There was no more Housekeeping!!! Incredible! This is not Hilton standard! want pictures of the room?"
Excelent,One night stay but definitely going back!,"The hotel is conveniently located to the water, top shopping, delicious restaurants, and cruise departure port. The hotel was clean, breakfast adequate and the staff was friendly and most helpful. I loved the convenience of walking to everything I needed. Great Brickell mall! Good food! Safe area! Only 10 minute ride to the cruise port. Definitely recommend. Didn’t use the pool, but was in a nice outdoor area."
Excelent,Nice Hampton Inn,This is great Hampton Inn. The front desk staff were friendly and courteous. The rooms and common areas were very clean and the breakfast was good. We stayed overnight prior to a cruise and will definitely consider this property again in the future.
Excelent,Great hotel!,"We stayed here for one night before our cruise. Lovely hotel! Perfect distance to the metromover.  Staff was so great. They upgraded us and we had a lovely suite on the top floor!  It was so clean and comfortable. Easy check in and check out. Great buffet in the morning.  Kind of an odd, unlabeled entrance when the uber dropped us off initially, we were not sure if we were in the right place but staff escorted us to the lobby on 6th floor and it was beautiful.  Will for sure stay here for our next cruise. "
Excelent,Awesome place,Great place comfortable setting. Love the scenic view of the city. Free breakfast was AWESOME!!! Because we were starving like Marvin 😂 we truely enjoyed the security guy David he was from where we from so great conversations. 
Very Good,New Year's eve in Miami,Great location and value given the dates over New Years and proximity to the New Years celebration downtown.  Complimentary breakfast was well above average.  Only downside was the bed wasn't very comfortable in my opinion.
Excelent,Helpful staff,"Staff was helpful and went out of their way to assist when the business center computers went down at 2AM.  Very pleased with the service.  Hotel breakfast was surprisingly nice, a lot of variety.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a downtown hotel."
Excelent,Post Covid Stay just as great as the always,"This has become our go to hotel in Miami for pre-cruise stays.  We stayed in Sept booking 2 rooms for myself and family. We love it for many reasons, but in no specific order,  You will love: The great clean rooms The fabulous staff How easy it is to get from the airport via the train Easy way to get around - Including the Free Miami Trolley just a block away Very Good Breakfast Many options near by for dinner  We will be staying there again in Dec. for our next cruise."
Average,The Curtain Story,"Average hotel. Very convenient location. Reception and breakfast was OK. Reception staff were extremely friendly and professional.  Once we checked-in, I was very disappointed when we noticed that  the windows had no curtains, black-outs or shades. Extremely odd. We were shocked. The least the hotel should do is place curtains for each room."
Excelent,Five star visit all around,"This was a solid 5 star experience. The building is well maintained, the room was spacious and the team were very friendly and helpful. My sister & I were making a sign for a ballgame and needed some office items (pen, tape). Marvens was very accommodating and helpful.  The breakfast was good and the area well maintained. I loved the PacMan & Galaxie machines- great touch."
Excelent,Centralized spot for travel.,House keeping Destinee went above and beyond to keep our room clean and supplies every day. Hotel was well decorated and staff very friendly. I would highly recommend this place. Parking is very secure and guarded. Convenient to airport and cruise line. 
Excelent,The best!,"Please stay here! Everything about this place is amazing and the customer service is out of this world!! As soon as we walked through the door, just the air was welcoming..haha. The room was very spacious and CLEAN and there’s so many nice lounges, bars, restaurants and stores  in walking distance."
Excelent,Very convenient location,This hotel is in a great neighborhood; very safe and clean area.  Lots of restaurants nearby.  The hotel itself offers great amenities for a family trip.  Excellent facility; and the staff is very accommodating.  Expect to pay for parking and a rollaway.
Average,Construction noise unbearable,"Construction was next to my room and they start at 8 am… I felt someone is drilling in my head. Was unbearable. Also breakfast was subpar to Hampton Inn.. Usually it is better than this. The hotel is clean and new and staff are nice, but like I said."
Excelent,The place to stay!,Clean. Professional staff. Friendly staff. Great breakfast. In the heart of many great good establishments. Worth the price. Rooms are good-smelling! Atmosphere is warm. Smell good throughout the facility. 
Excelent,Birthday Trip,Had a great experience. All the staff was very helpful and friendly. Located near some great restaurants and nightlife experience. Also appeared to be a very family friendly hotel. The complimentary breakfast was very good. I have had complimentary breakfast at other hotels but this by far was the best. I would definitely stay here again if I was traveling to Miami again.
Excelent,Great Hotel!,We recently stayed at Hampton Inn and Suites in Downtown Miami Brickell. The hotel staff was friendly. Our room was very nice and clean. The lobby was well maintained and clean. We would stay at this hotel again.
Excelent,Great room and great service.,"Upon check in I was greeted, process was fast and with a smile. Room was clean and had a great view. Loved the pool and everyone was kind and attentive. Wish I could’ve experienced the restaurants but didn’t have time, they still looked beautiful. The breakfast as well. Will definitely stay here again."
Very Good,Great location,Great location for my purposes. Close to lots of restaurant. Easy access to transit with nearby train and bus station. Some shopping around but I didn't do much of. Lots of parking albeit for a fee. Hotel was clean and rooms were well kept. Staff was very friendly and hospitable 
Excelent,Good location and service,"This is a nice, safe location. Staff was friendly and helpful. Complimentary breakfast was good. We came for next day cruise. There was a shuttle for a cost available to the port. Coyo Taco was in walking distance. Plus 2 other eating places & sports bar. We were very pleased with everything."
Excelent,Nothing wrong here,"We stayed one night before our cruise out of the Miami port.  There are 3 restaurants connected to the hotel.  We enjoyed sitting outside on the deck of the Gastro Pub, and our meal was fine.  There is a pool and bar in the hotel which are very well appointed.  Our room was very nice, the shuttle to the port was very handy and no complaints about this hotel.  I would stay again."
Excelent,Amazing hotel and affordable during spring break.,Hotel has every amenity you can think of.  Amazing free breakfast in the morning. Very nice pool and fitness center. It's also very close to a strip mall that's walking distance. I was here for a cruise and it was very close by. Front desk was very friendly as well.
Excelent,Pre cruise stay,"Just like all the other review, we had a fantastic stay.  Area is awesome with lots of restaurants to walk through.  Hotel staff was very nice and bonus cocktail reception was a nice plus. Breakfast was super busy but they did a good job restocking everything.   Would stay again pre cruise no doubt."
Excelent,Miami pre cruise vacation,Great stay in an amazing location with top notch service.  The rooms were clean and spacious.  The beds and pillows were very comfortable and clean.  We went to the bar and got prompt and friendly service plus complimentary drink.  
Excelent,Great place to stay.,"My family and I had a great visit. The room was clean and the hotel nice. John at the front desk was really great. The bar was closed, so that was the only bummer but overall, I would definitely go back again."
Excelent,Well run hotel in Miami,"First time in Miami. Excellent hotel.Arrived early,left suitcase at the hotel and took the monorail half a block away to a huge indoor mall. You can see monorail from hotel,and only a few $$. Staff so helpful and called us near noon to say our room was ready....we were up all night traveling..Rooms were exactly as they should be,and breakfast was as usual for Hampton Inn,something for everyone.and kept well stocked.Will definitely use this hotel on my next cruise or holiday. Hotel has its on shuttle to cruise ship."
Very Good,Nice hotel,Friendly staff. Good location from cruise port. Stayed here before. Fun pool area with bar walk up window. A bit pricey overall but Brickell is a spendy neighborhood.  Pizza place around the corner is great.  Bartenders are nice and good cocktail builders.  
Excelent,John P was amazing.,"Great place , awesome service. Makes me love Florida more. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family. Awesome !  Shout out to John Papazoglou Looking out for my family at the last minute to check in, He still looked out."
Excelent,What a great property!,"Wonderful hotel.  Great staff - David checked us in and was so welcoming!  Great rooms, fitness center, breakfast. Close to the Metrorail and restaurants.  This place has a lot going for it and it is very easy to recommend it!"
Excelent,Icing on the cake of family vacation,"This hotel was all I hoped for, clean, professional staff, great amenities and affordable.  I will definitely be returning.  The hotel made a great famiy vacation into an amazing family vacation!  Perfect location. "
Excelent,This place rocks,Such a nice location in Miami . Close enough to experience the downtown nightlife and the beach all in one night. I'd definitely go back to this hotel and stay again . The breakfast was great and the staff was even better.
Excelent,Best Service Ever!!!!,"From the moment I walked into the door I was greeted professionally .I'm giving a big shout out to Victoria for such amazing service. She was very hospitable, knowledgeable and fast. I cant wait to co.e back"
Excelent,Excellent hotel!!!!!,Very clean.  Convenient location.  Close to some very good restaurants (especially Batch).  Reasonably close to beach.  Very easy to get to airport. Complementary drinks and snacks.  Easy parking. Would definitely recommend staying at this hotel.  
Excelent,Great Location,"Would definitely recommend a stay at this Hotel. Friendly and helpful staff and a buffet breakfast included in our stay. Great location with restaurants, shops and the the metro train service all near by.  "
Very Good,Girls trip,Perfect location. Away from the beach crowd but a short drive to it. Nice downtown area with shops and restaurants to walk to. Not a long drive to the airport. Staff is friendly. Rooftop pool was nice although we didn’t have time to get in. 
Excelent,Great stay friendliest staff ever!,Great hotel but what stands out for me is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Nothingness too much trouble for them and plenty of time to discuss my requirements. Trainee concierge was a gem too lovely smile and so happy. Pleasure staying at Hampton Inn
Excelent,WOW!,"My family and I travel quite a bit and have stayed at some really nice hotels and resorts through the years as well as some common, large hotel chains. I searched numerous hotels and read tons of reviews on Trip advisor before ultimately selecting this property due to the rave reviews it received. This hotel definitely did not disappoint. As a matter of fact there were so many reasons to say ""Wow!"" The hotel is simply beautiful! This was not at all what we would have expected from a Hampton Inn. There were so many wonderful features. The beds were incredibly comfortable, the staff was accommodating for our late night check in and the hotel ensured guest safety by requiring a key to access all guest floors. There's a fun interactive painting of doors by the check in desk that my"
Terrible,Tried to scam money,This is the second time i stayed at this hotel and will be the last. Watch out for their scam. I came back to Australia and found out someone from the hotel used my credit card after I left. They took 880 australian. My bank stopped my card and asked me to ring them. When i did so the manager said no one at the hotel had done this and there were no record of these charges. They even said it may be a different hampton inn and could i come in to see them. So they are ignorant of where australia is!! Not surprising. Anyway i get a survey to fill in about how i rated the hotel😂😂😂 Not surprisingly after i filled in the survey I  an email from the manager to say now yes they did take this money and please could they contact my bank!! Still waiting for the charges to be reversed. I
Terrible,Slamming Doors. Thin Walls. No Sleep :(,Entering the hotel we were confronted with the first problem. We had seven suitcases. We were dropped at the front door by the taxi that indicated to the concierge that we would need help. But unfortunately the concierge did nothing. Just stood there and watched us. We dragged our bags to the elevator and then went to the 6th floor where once again I had to drag the bags from the elevator to reception. No one offered any help. We asked reception for a porter and they said they don't have porters. I asked how we would get our bags from the elevator to the room. After signing in we still had to ask for a trolley to put our bags on. Only then did the receptionist get a trolley for us. The next negative thing we experienced was the noise. It seemed to be that there was a general
Excelent,Great choice for pre-cruise,"We stayed here one night pre-cruise. We were delighted at how nice the hotel was, after a long transcontinental flight. Check-in was a breeze, and we were pleasantly surprised with the extra amenities on the ""elite"" floor.  The room was clean and fresh, and the bed was very comfortable. The pool was a great place to relax after the long flight, and the pool bar staff were very attentive. We were also impressed with all of the artwork that was showcased throughout the hotel.  The hotel is in a convenient location, with a number of restaurants nearby, and a Publix within a few blocks for the last minute supplies for our trip. Our Uber ride from Ft Lauderdale airport was less than $40, and the taxi to the port was under $15.   The complimentary breakfast was much more extensive"
Average,Nice but not perfect,"I picked this hotel based on the reviews on TripAdvisor and was a bit disappointed given the high ranking. First, and most important, the hotel is clean and safe. The staff were all pleasurable and the property is centrally located close to many restaurants and shopping.   The room itself did have a few issues that made the stay less than perfect.  The most annoying was the fact you could not adjust the cooling below 70 degrees. The hotel limited this temperature on the thermostat. Given that you are in Miami with humidity, I could not keep the room at a comfortable temperature.  You could not also adjust the thermostat so that you could keep the fan running unless the unit was cooling. This would have been nice to keep the air circulating and create white noise.   With no"
Excelent,The Only Place I Will Stay in Miami,"My wife and I have stayed in the past at this absolutely wonderful hotel. We recently returned for two nights for a pre and post cruise stay.  The Staff are outstanding and very accommodating. It is obvious that they take pride in their work. We were given an upgraded room on the 15 floor with a lovely view. The room was spacious, clean and so comfortable.  Breakfast was yummy with a well stocked breakfast area. Tables are kept cleaned, we even noticed the Supervisor helping out.  Two complimentary drink tickets are included which was a nice touch that we enjoyed sitting at the bar which overlooks the pool area. The pool was great as was the jacuzzi.  Brickell is a nice area of Miami. The free Metro Mover is nearby. We took the Orange Line Metro Train to and from the airport for"
Excelent,Pre cruise,"We booked here after reading all the great reviews. Took a taxi from airport, should have taken the metro, it was almost across the st from the hotel. We were on an early flight and room wasn't ready yet, they put us on a list and called as soon as the room was ready. We actually got upgraded to a king suite which was awesome. The room was beautiful no issues at all. Each quest is given a coupon for a free drink at the bar, we enjoyed ours by the pool. The breakfast in the morning was very well done. Coffee and tea are  located in several areas so it's not so congested. Many food choices. The area is very clean. The staff are all very friendly and professional. We signed up for the shuttle to the port, 8 dollars per person. We ate at the restaurant next door, and that was very"
Terrible,75 Degrees Fahrenheit in your room,Upon arrival I found my room at 75 F. Turns out the Airconditioning has a motion sensor. If nobody's in the room the temperature defaults to 75 F.  The first room I got had a motion sensor defect. No A/C in Miami was not an option. Then the second room I was assigned to had a working A/C unit but turns out that the blower was preset to low and the lowest temperature possible was also preset to 69 F.  The front desk told me to wait 30 minutes and to move around in my room to activate the motion sensor.  After 30 minutes of waiting and moving around the temperature remained at 75 F in my room and I decided to leave the hotel.  I was soaked in sweat. Enough!  This is a place for people who like it warm. I saw many happy and sweaty tourists in the elevator in flip flops and shorts. 
Average,Nice hotel....so-so neighborhood.,"I stayed at this hotel for a pre-cruise stay before sailing off to the Bahamas in May 2016.  I am going to start off by saying I am on a different plane than everybody else who reviews this hotel.  I liked this hotel but I really didn’t like the neighborhood.  Let’s start at the beginning.  When we arrived, we were directed to the reception/lobby located on the 6th floor.  The Concierge is on the 1st floor and parking is from floors 2-5.  We were welcomed warmly by staff everywhere we went and treated my toddler daughter well.  The room was good, cool (temperature-wise), super clean and modern.  I only booked a regular room, not a suite, so my room did not have a microwave or a refrigerator.  I don’t like that.  I don’t feel like being properly dressed to go down the hall to get"
Terrible,"this is a 1 star hotel, do not understand all the rave reviews","I checked into my usd 350 per night "" suite "" and found that it had no minibar/refrigerator, so went back down to the reception which is on the 6th floor, not at the gorund floor, which really would have been a lot more logical, anyway, in order to get a regrigerator I need to pay usd 50 more per day, making it an even usd 400.  when I tried to tell the guys at the recception that I had NEVER been in any hotel room, anywhere in the world which did not have a refrigerator, there was one guy in particular who was obnoxious and started arguing with me, he told me the option to have a refrigerator was on their website, I honestly do not remember that, but that is not something I would EVER look for !! I really take that for granted, especially at usd 350 per day !  His name was"
Poor,Disappointed in Hampton Inn - do not recommend,"It is not often that I find myself leaving a negative review, however, Hampton Inn truly does not leave me any other choice. There were benefits to this hotel - location, clean room, and nice pool area.   We stayed on Saturday, December 27th and experienced an excessive amount of noise (banging, to be exact). When my husband provided this information, instead of an apology, he received a defensive reaction regarding NYE approaching and that it was our responsibility to contact security. There was no attempt to provide a genuine and empathetic answer.   Having traveled to eleven countries in 2014 with countless positive interactions with hotels, I do not appreciate the condescending tone of their response, and for us, it confirms our decision to support other hotel chains that"
Excelent,Before cruise stay,"What an awesome hotel in the heart of Miami!  We had two rooms booked for my family and I prior to our cruise and we enjoyed our stay.  The rooms were clean, bed comfy and nice views. We used the pool and it had even better views on the 6th floor and it is an outdoor pool.  The pool was very warm in fact Miami warm and there is a bar just inside the doors.  Breakfast was awesome! We found a Publix grocery store close by and purchased dinner there and brought it back to the room instead of the many dining options in the area to save $$$. In the morning the hotel concierge ordered us a cab for the seven of us and it took us less than 10 minutes to get to the port. We will stay again the next time we cruise out of Miami"
Excelent,"Stayed November 23, 2013 Pre Cruise","We stayed here the night before our cruise. We have cruised out of Miami several times but have never stayed pre cruise before.   Being unaware of Downtown Miami and the surroundings I was uneasy with making reservations anywhere. Originally our reservations were made with the Hyatt. Afterwards, I read reviews of hotels downtown and this hotel had excellent reviews along with the Mary Brickell village. I was also impressed that the manager Eduardo replied to the reviews, which assured me that he was dedicated to customer opinions and what was needed, if any for improvement. For that reason I switched my reservation from the Hyatt to this hotel and used the Florida Resident rate online.  Upon arriving at the hotel to check in we found out that the room that I booked online was"
Terrible,Very Disappointed,"I have stayed here before and I do business in the area for the Federal Government.  Recently the hotel decided to not offer the approved federal government rates even though I made the reservation and checked federal rate (their rate was higher than the approved rate, but still advertised it at the federal rate).  When I called Management they were less than helpful resolving the issue.  The management at the South Beach Marriott really helped my travel companions out and were more than happy to offer the military the approved rate.  The workers in the kitchen and front desk are very nice, but it's a shame that 40 of my Hilton Gold members coworkers staying in Miami over 400 nights a year will now be staying somewhere else."
Excelent,Great Miami Hotel,"We stayed at the Hampton Inn & Suites Miami Brickell for 6 nights (1/22 – 1/28/2012). We arrived early in the morning, after a cruise, so we need to leave our luggage at the hotel greeting area on the first floor because there is no room available at that moment.  The first five floors are parking spaces and the hotel lobby itself as well as the breakfast area were located on the 6th floor. The room was spacious and clean with very comfortable beds. The bathroom is functional and clean (it would be better if more hangers were available). There is a metromover station (downtown Miami free transportation vehicle)  and a Metrorail (subway) station on the corner as well as lots of restaurants nearby. Two Publix (supermarket) are also available at two/three blocks of distance. There"
Terrible,They threw my mom out!,"Stayed here for 2 nights, 12/13 and 12/14 with some buddies to celebrate the end of college final exams before heading home to NJ. Great area in downtown close to bars and restaurants. Found out a week before my trip that my mother was staying on a yacht with friends a few blocks away at Vice City Marina. My buddies and I had to leave the hotel at 10am for an 11am excursion out of Bayside Marketplace. I told my mom to come meet me on the 6th floor lobby at 7:30am Saturday morning so we could have coffee and talk for an hour or so since my buddies were asleep upstairs and were going to be getting up soon to shower. My mom brought us a left over sandwich platter from La Sandwicherie in Brickell to give us and arrived to the hotel about 15 minutes early. I told her to grab a table"
Excelent,A Fantastic Stay!,"After a long flight and a sketchy cab ride we arrived late evening the night prior to our cruise departure. Exhausted, we were met at reception by John. He immediately made us feel welcome. A recent member to the Hilton Honours Program, I had not accumulated any points to warrant an upgrade. That’s exactly what John gave us, 16 th floor allocated to Elite members. The King Suite was well appointed. Complimentary snacks, pop, water and chocolate bar. Nespresso machine was much appreciated in the morning. Loved the bathroom amenities and rain head shower. We headed down to the bar after settling into our room for drinks with the voucher given to us at check in. WiFi was complimentary and worked well.  Breakfast was included in the price of the room and had a great selection. It"
Excelent,Perfect pre-cruise convenience,"My boyfriend and I were going on our first cruise. I wanted to find a hotel that wasn't too far from the port but not too expensive. I also prefer two queen beds (not double). My boyfriend is tall so he needs the longer bed. We booked a room that included a shuttle to the port.   This location is great. We were able to take the train from MIA. The hotel is just steps from the station. From the hotel, we could walk to a bunch of different restaurants. It's also convenient and affordable to take an Uber or Lyft to other locations. I highly recommend checking out Coyo Taco which is within a block of the hotel.  The room was clean. I loved that the mirror was heated so you could see it after someone took a shower. Nice touch. The employees were helpful. They held my suitcase for the"
Excelent,Impressive value for the quality of stay.,"Stayed here twice and delighted with extremely polite and welcoming staff, modern clean decor and and value for money.  Hampton Inn breakfast offerings very good and was impressed every day by staff such as Stephania who never stopped clearing, restocking and helping people individually. (Am always disgusted by mentality of guests who can't even be bothered to drop a cup in the trash on their way out let alone clear their own mess.) Thanks Stephania! Unfortunately because of the huge cruise crowd who stay here before the boarding breakfast is usually a rush if your timing is poor. Had to wait around for a table to empty several times. (Need for a few more for couples.)  Rooms comfortable and clean. Elite floors offer a little more if you either reserve or get upgraded but don't"
Terrible,Charged for the room even though I had to cancel...,"I cancelled my room in November because it was a little more than I thought I could afford right at Christmas....I stayed in a room at a Marriott facility and used points I had accumulated...the day we were leaving Florida I got an email from this Hampton Inn thanking me for staying...I immediately called and spoke with the desk clerk telling her I didn't stay there and had to cancel...I told her she should see that we never checked in..she said unless I could prove that I had cancelled, my credit card would be billed $200.00 even though it could have been a computer glitche.....I could not find the cancellation and my credit card has been charged!!! I spoke with a Hilton Honors representative last night who was very kind and understanding but she could not help get my money"
Excelent,This is not your typical Hampton Inn.,This is probably the value for your money in Miami.  This is not your typical Hampton Inn.  Amazing accommodations and service. The rooms are large and you have an awesome view of Miami.  The hotel is very clean and elegant in addition to being very spacious. The conference rooms are well appointed.
Average,Lots of problems,"I want to be sure others who rely on Trip Advisor have a solid perception of this hotel. It may very well be a decent value for the money. It is not the number one hotel in Miami, especially given the problems we encountered.  First BIG problem: hotel did not have our reservation in its system. Which normally is not a problem since I had booked through Hilton.com and had a confirmation in my hand. Except...they made us stand there a full 45 minutes while they sorted out the reason for the glitch (this being at 8 pm at night after a 2 1/2 hour flight). They literally told me despite my confirmation they could not check me in. THAT is ridiculous.  Second problem: the towel rod in the bathroom dropped off the wall the first time I went to get a towel from it. Quickly repaired? Yes."
Very Good,Great Place to Stay before a cruise,Went on a cruise in September and took a chance with this hotel.  What a pleasant surprise!  We choose the larger 2 queen room and it was very spacious and accommodating.  Since we are residents of Florida we opted for the resident package which gave us free parking and 2 drinks in the hotel bar.  Parking is $18 a night but for Miami that is the going rate.  The free breakfast comes with every room type which is a great plus and believe it or not it was quite good especially the make it yourself waffles and toppings.  We only had one problem and that was the reservation system was down our entire stay so we had to be escorted to our room twice on our first night and then again the next day after breakfast because none of the room keys that were being made would work.  You are
Average,Great for location.  Not so great for everything else,"No question that the location is the ideal, so if that's your focus this might be the best choice for you.  But if you're looking for an awesome room or service that knocks your socks off, this is not the place.  Additionally it is overpriced for what it is.  Now to be fair, this is a Hampton Inn and it doesn't claim to be any more than that.  So for those that complain about the lack of room service, valet parking, bellman, an actual restaurant, etc...  this is not a Hilton, Marriott nor a Hyatt so you shouldn't expect any of that.  No Hamptons have these services as Hampton Inn is the lower category brand of the Hilton family, similar to a Holiday Inn Express.  But on the other hand most Hamptons provide microwaves and mini-fridges in every room, so going in knowing and"
Terrible,Disappointed Customer,I booked a suite for 1 night on 2/22/14 for $303.00 and checked in at 12midnight (it was just to sleep before I arrived to my next destination).  When I arrived to the suite the toilet was broken and it took 1 hour for someone to arrive to fix it.  Theat person who arrived to fix it was the security guard on call and all he did was bring me a plunger and towels to put on the floor.  The next morning when I checked out I complained to the manager on duty and she was embarrassed and to make up for the inconvenience she said they would give me a free night stay per company policy.  She said she would send me an email confirmation.  It has been 2 months since that night and I still have not received that email confirmation.   I am very appalled with the hotel.
Excelent,Convenient,"We stayed here for 2 nights before a cruise. It is downtown, not on the beach but in a really good location. We arrived by sky train from the airport ($2.25) and walked to the hotel. Really convenient. It is around the corner from both the railway and the monorail. The hotel itself is clean, modern with very large rooms. The bathroom was immaculate and the room was spacious and we'll lit. The breakfast was good with a big selection and there is a nice bar for that night cap. You couldn't ask for more. The staff were professional and very helpful. The concierge was particularly knowledgeable. A very short walk from the hotel is everything you could need. Restaurants, bars, and drugstore. Overall a really good hotel in a convenient location."
Excelent,Best value and service in downtown Miami,"I had 21 stays at this property in 2013 (qualified for Hilton Gold just based on stays at this hotel) so I've had the chance to see every room configuration and use all the amenities numerous times. I've also stayed at many other hotels in Miami (including JW Marriott Marquis, Conrad and others) and this hotel is hands down my favorite. Customer service is a top priority, and the friendliness of the staff far exceeds the experience at other, much more expensive hotels.  The main level of the hotel is the large and impressive sky lobby on the 6th floor (typical for Miami hotels) which has the registration desk, concierge, pool, fitness center, bar and breakfast area. Check in is usually fast and the front desk staff (Francisco / Rodney / Eric and others) are efficient and very"
